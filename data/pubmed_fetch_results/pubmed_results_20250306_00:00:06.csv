BACKGROUND: Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist with psychedelic properties, shows promise as a novel treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). While current studies involve two dosing sessions, the effects of a single dose have not been investigated. AIMS: To investigate the pharmacokinetics, feasibility, safety and efficacy of single-dose psilocybin therapy in AUD. METHODS: This open-label, single-group study investigated single-dose psilocybin therapy in 10 treatment-seeking adults (8 men and 2 women; median age 44 years) with severe AUD. The treatment involved two preparation sessions, a high-dose psilocybin session (25 mg) and two integration sessions. Pharmacokinetics were determined by noncompartmental analysis, and changes in alcohol consumption, craving and self-efficacy, were assessed using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Notable between-participant pharmacokinetic variations were observed, with peak plasma psilocin concentrations ranging from 14 to 59 µg/L. Alcohol consumption significantly decreased over the 12 weeks following psilocybin administration. Heavy drinking days were reduced by 37.5 percentage points (95% CI: -61.1 to -13.9,  CONCLUSIONS: Despite pharmacokinetic variations, a single 25 mg psilocybin dose was safe and effective in reducing alcohol consumption in AUD patients. Larger randomised, placebo-controlled, single-dose AUD trials are warranted. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04718792."

To elucidate the brain effects of psilocybin, we directly compared the acute effects of 5-HT2AR agonist (psilocybin) and antagonist (ketanserin) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a single-blind, cross-over study in 28 healthy participants. We evaluated associations between plasma psilocin level (PPL) or subjective drug intensity (SDI) and CBF. We also evaluated drug effects on internal carotid artery (ICA) diameter using time-of-flight MRI angiography. PPL and SDI were significantly negatively associated with regional and global CBF (∼11.6% at peak drug effect, p < 0.0001). CBF did not significantly change following ketanserin (2.3%, p = 0.35).

BACKGROUND: Psychedelic assisted psychotherapy (PAP) can improve treatment-resistant depression. Its usefulness in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. PD patients may have problems adjusting to their chronic progressive neurological disease. A change from emotional avoidance to acceptance has been reported following psilocybin administration in patients with treatment-resistant depression. OBJECTIVE: To report for the first time the effect of psilocybin in a PD patient. METHODS: A non-depressed 43-year-old female with a 2-year history of PD presented with difficulty adjusting to PD, anxious ruminations and pessimism. The patient declined an increase in dopaminergic medication or the introduction of an anxiolytic. Therapeutic patient education was not beneficial. The patient received four sessions of high-dose PAP within one year. Neurological and psychiatric assessments were performed before and at one year follow-up using qualitative interviews and quantitative assessment of motor status, dispositional optimism, depression, anxiety, apathy, and well-being. RESULTS: PAP was well tolerated. It significantly improved the patient's overall pessimistic outlook on her future and decreased her anxious ruminations and worries about potential handicap due to PD.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an open-label, single-arm clinical trial. 20 adults meeting DSM-5-TR criteria for methamphetamine use disorder who are seeking to reduce or cease methamphetamine use will be enrolled in the study through a single-site specialist outpatient stimulant treatment service in inner Sydney (St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney). A 4-week course with three subcutaneous ketamine doses (0.75 mg/kg to 0.9 mg/kg, titrated according to tolerability) at weekly intervals and four sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy (one at treatment initiation and three within 24-48 hours following each ketamine administration session) will be delivered. Safety and feasibility will be assessed over an 8-week period. Secondary outcomes (changes in methamphetamine use, cravings, withdrawal, quality of life and treatment satisfaction) will be assessed over a 24-week period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the St Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee, reference 2023/ETH00530. Study findings will be disseminated through articles in scientific, peer-reviewed journals, and at national and international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ANZCTR: ACTRN12624000895583. PROTOCOL VERSION: The trial protocol (Version 4.0) was approved on 24 June 2024."

To address this issue, machine learning methods could assist in the detection of recreational drug use. AIMS: To investigate the accuracy of a machine learning model using clinical, biological and echocardiographic data for detecting recreational drug use in patients admitted to intensive cardiac care units. METHODS: From 07 to 22 April 2021, systematic screening for all traditional recreational drugs (cannabis, opioids, cocaine, amphetamines, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) was performed by urinary testing in all consecutive patients admitted to intensive cardiac care units in 39 French centres.

The framework involved automated variable selection by eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and model building with multiple algorithms, using 31 centres as the derivation cohort and eight other centres as the validation cohort. RESULTS: Among the 1499 patients undergoing urinary testing for drugs (mean age 63±15 years; 70% male), 161 (11%) tested positive (cannabis: 9.1%; opioids: 2.1%; cocaine: 1.7%; amphetamines: 0.7%; 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine: 0.6%).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to update evidence about the efficacy and safety of using ketamine and esketamine to reduce PPD incidence. METHODS: We searched four databases, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane, to collect relevant studies.

RESULTS: The studies include ketamine augmentation of other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), various routes of administration - intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), and intranasal (IN) - and single versus multiple dose designs. Multiple doses of IV ketamine/S-ketamine produced reductions in SI for periods of several days to weeks, while single doses showed shorter, more variable effects. Multiple and single doses of IN ketamine/S-ketamine and single doses of IV ketamine produced less consistent anti-SI results. IN and IV ketamine/S-ketamine administration appears to be well tolerated.

We aimed to evaluate the intraoperative safety and efficacy of weak opioidized anesthesia with low-dose esketamine in the treatment of elderly patients with lumbar spinal stenosis undergoing total laminectomy with complete decompression and interbody implant fusion. METHODS: In total, 90 elderly patients were randomized into three groups: the esketamine HS group (0.2 mg/kg induction, 0.25 mg/(kg·h) infusion), the esketamine LS group (0.2 mg/kg induction, 0.125 mg/(kg·h) infusion), and the control group (group C receiving an equal volume of saline). The primary outcome was the cumulative dose of sufentanil administered during the perioperative period. Pain (VAS rest and movement scores) on preoperative day 1 (POD-1), postoperative day 1 (POD1), postoperative day 3 (POD3), and postoperative day 7 (POD7), and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) on POD-1, POD1, POD3, and POD7 were the secondary outcomes. We also measured mean arterial pressure and the heart rate of the three groups at each time point before anesthesia (T0), immediately after intubation (T1), 5 min after intubation (T2), at the time of surgical skin incision (T3), at the time of extubation (T4), and 30 min after surgery (T5), intraoperative propofol and remifentanil dosage, and the incidence of adverse reactions within 5 days postoperatively, etc. RESULTS: The cumulative perioperative sufentanil dosage and the number of patients undergoing postoperative PACU remedial analgesia were significantly lower in the HS and LS groups compared to the C group (P < 0.05). Cumulative perioperative sufentanil use was lower in the HS group compared with the LS group (P < 0.01). The VAS dynamic and static pain scores were significantly lower in the HS group at POD1 compared to the C and LS groups. There was no significant difference in VAS dynamic and static pain scores among the three groups at POD3 and POD7 (P > 0.05). At POD1, the VAS dynamic and static pain scores were significantly lower in the HS group compared to the C and LS groups. VAS static pain scores were lower in the LS group at POD1 compared to group C (P < 0.05), whereas VAS dynamic pain scores did not differ compared to group C (P > 0.05). Compared with group C, the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly lower in the HS and LS groups at POD1, POD3, and POD7. At POD1 and POD3, the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were lower in the HS group than in the LS group (P < 0.05). Serum IL-10 levels were significantly increased at POD1, POD3, and POD7 in the HS and LS groups compared with group C (P < 0.05). The incidence of intraoperative hypotension was significantly lower in the HS and LS groups compared with group C (P < 0.05). At T2 and T4, the HS and LS groups had significantly lower levels of MAP and HR decline than the C group. At T5, the MAP and HR of the C group were significantly higher than those of the HS and LS groups (P < 0.05). The HR at T3 was reduced in the LS group compared with the C and HS groups (P < 0.05).

BACKGROUND: In the context of the need to increase treatment options for substance use disorders, recent research has evaluated the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. However, there is an incomplete understanding of psychedelics' effects on craving, a core symptom of addictive disorders and a predictor of substance use and relapse. AIMS: To determine if the use of psychedelics is associated with changes in craving in humans. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature, using PubMed, PsycInfo, and Scopus databases up to May 2023. We included all studies assessing any substance craving levels after psychedelic use (protocol registration number CRD42021242856). RESULTS: Thirty-eight published articles were included, corresponding to 31 studies and 2639 participants, pertaining either to alcohol, opioid, cocaine, or tobacco use disorders. Twelve of the 31 included studies reported a significant decrease in craving scores following psychedelic use.

Despite its prevalence, the mechanisms behind OCD remain elusive, and current treatments are limited. This protocol outlines an investigative study for individuals with OCD, exploring the potential of psilocybin to improve key components of cognition implicated in the disorder. The PsilOCD study strives to assess the effects of low-moderate psilocybin treatment (10 mg) alongside non-interventional therapy on several facets of OCD. The main focus points of PsilOCD are cognitive flexibility, measured with cognitive tests, and neuroplasticity, assessed through electroencephalography (EEG). METHODS: 20 blinded participants with OCD will complete two dosing sessions, separated by four weeks, where they will receive 1 mg of psilocybin on the first and 10 mg on the second. The first dose serves as an active placebo, and the latter is a low-moderate dose that induces relatively mild-moderate emotional and perceptual effects. Participants will be supported by trained psychedelic therapists, who will sit with them during each dosing session and provide virtual preparation and integration sessions over the 12-week study period. Therapeutic support will be the same for both the 1 mg and 10 mg sessions. PsilOCD's primary outcomes include scores in the intradimensional-extradimensional (ID-ED) shift task, which is an established measure of cognitive flexibility, and neuroplasticity as quantified by a visual long-term potentiation (vLTP) task. This task is delivered as part of an EEG paradigm and measures acute quantified changes in neuroplasticity in the brain's visual system. The ID-ED task will be conducted twice, two days after each dosing session, and the EEG recordings will also be taken twice, immediately after each session.

Respondents predominantly endorsed using MDMA, LSD, DMT, and psilocybin. The predominant methods of administration were oral. Most reported using psychedelics for recreational purposes. The most endorsed acute effects were hallucinations, increased heart rate, positive mood, and visual tracers, while the most endorsed residual effects were headaches/migraine, dry mouth, nausea, hallucinations, and anxiety.

To this end, 1,486 eligible respondents (Mage = 29.58, 67.1% male) residing in the United States completed an online survey designed to assess the types of psychedelics used, methods of administration and dosing, frequency of use, intentions for use, context/environments in which they are used, perceived acute effects, frequency of those effects and distress about them, and their perceived residual effects and distress about them. Respondents predominantly endorsed using MDMA, LSD, DMT, and psilocybin. The predominant methods of administration were oral. Most reported using psychedelics for recreational purposes. The most endorsed acute effects were hallucinations, increased heart rate, positive mood, and visual tracers, while the most endorsed residual effects were headaches/migraine, dry mouth, nausea, hallucinations, and anxiety. Participants were most distressed by negative mood states, vomiting, and nausea when under the acute effects of psychedelics, but mean distress ratings were low. These results can help inform clinical trials, reform policy regarding legal access to psychedelics, and track changes in these metrics as sociocultural and legal landscapes continue to shift."

METHODS: MEDLINE was searched with the keyword ""esketamine"" on March 24, 2024, using the PRISMA method.

OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aims to quantify the acute effects of psilocybin on executive functions and attention, while examining how dosage, timing of administration, cognitive domain, and task characteristics moderate these effects. METHODS: A systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis were conducted on empirical studies assessing psilocybin's acute effects on working memory, conflict monitoring, response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and attention. Effect sizes for reaction time (RT) and accuracy (ACC) were calculated, exploring the effects of timing (on-peak defined as 90-180 min post-administration), dosage, cognitive function categories, and task sensitivity to executive functions as potential moderators. RESULTS: Thirteen studies (42 effect sizes) were included.

Significant between-study heterogeneity was found for both RT and ACC. Task sensitivity to executive functions moderated RT effects. Publication bias was evident, but the overall effect remained significant after adjustment for this.

The current opioid crisis has had an unprecedented public health impact. Approved medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) exist, yet their limitations indicate a need for innovative treatments. Limited preliminary clinical studies suggest specific psychedelics might aid OUD treatment, though most clinical evidence remains observational, with few controlled trials.

METHODS: Search terms were generated based on existing evidence of psilocybin's effects related to antidepressant mechanisms. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, 15 studies were systematically reviewed, exploring various therapeutic change principles such as brain dynamics, emotion regulation, cognition, self-referential processing, connectedness, and interpersonal functioning.

However, the long-term effects of PT have never been compared with gold-standard treatments for MDD such as pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy alone or in combination. METHODS: This is a 6-month follow-up study of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial involving patients with moderate-to-severe MDD. Participants were recruited from a hospital in the UK. Male or female patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV), moderate to severe depression (HAM-D ≥17), no MRI or SSRI contraindications, confirmed diagnosis by a GP or mental healthcare professional, aged 18-80, and competent in English were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either two 25 mg doses of the psychedelic drug psilocybin administered orally combined with psychological support ('psilocybin therapy' or PT) and book-ended by further support or a 6-week course of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (administered daily at 10 mg for three weeks and 20 mg for the subsequent three weeks) plus matched psychological support ('escitalopram treatment' or ET). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) at week 6, which has been reported previously. Herein, we present results at the 6-month follow-up time point. Measures of social functioning, connectedness, and meaning in life constituted the study's secondary outcomes during follow-up. Safety in the follow-up period was not assessed. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03429075. FINDINGS: Between January 15th, 2019 and March 20th, 2020, 59 patients were enrolled and 30 (11 females [37%] and 19 males [63%]) were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 (9 females [31%] and 20 males [69%]) to the escitalopram group. 25 participants in the PT group and 21 in the ET group completed the 6-month follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up, both PT and ET conditions yielded sustained improvements in depressive symptom severity. The mean between-condition difference in QIDS-SR-16 scores at 6-months was 1.51 (95% CI: -1.35, 4.38; p = 0.311). Secondary outcomes demonstrated that PT had greater mean between-condition differences in functioning (WSAS: -7.46; 95% CI: -12.4, -2.47; p < 0.001), psychological connectedness (WCS: 11.02; 95% CI: 1.25, 20.83; p = 0.033), and meaning in life (MLQ: 4.86; 95% CI: 0.67, 9.05; p = 0.021) compared to ET. INTERPRETATION: Six-week intensive treatments with either psilocybin or escitalopram (with psychological support) for MDD were associated with long-term improvements in depressive symptom severity. The greater degree of improvement in the PT arm at follow-up on psychosocial functioning, meaning in life, and psychological connectedness suggests warrant future research. However, these results are descriptive and should be interpreted with caution. Key limitations of the study include its suboptimal power to detect small but meaningful differences between treatments, missing data, the potential use of additional interventions during the follow-up period, and reliance on self-reported treatment assessments. These factors may affect the interpretation of the study findings and should be considered when evaluating the results.

The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) at week 6, which has been reported previously. Herein, we present results at the 6-month follow-up time point. Measures of social functioning, connectedness, and meaning in life constituted the study's secondary outcomes during follow-up. Safety in the follow-up period was not assessed. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03429075. FINDINGS: Between January 15th, 2019 and March 20th, 2020, 59 patients were enrolled and 30 (11 females [37%] and 19 males [63%]) were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 (9 females [31%] and 20 males [69%]) to the escitalopram group. 25 participants in the PT group and 21 in the ET group completed the 6-month follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up, both PT and ET conditions yielded sustained improvements in depressive symptom severity. The mean between-condition difference in QIDS-SR-16 scores at 6-months was 1.51 (95% CI: -1.35, 4.38; p = 0.311). Secondary outcomes demonstrated that PT had greater mean between-condition differences in functioning (WSAS: -7.46; 95% CI: -12.4, -2.47; p < 0.001), psychological connectedness (WCS: 11.02; 95% CI: 1.25, 20.83; p = 0.033), and meaning in life (MLQ: 4.86; 95% CI: 0.67, 9.05; p = 0.021) compared to ET. INTERPRETATION: Six-week intensive treatments with either psilocybin or escitalopram (with psychological support) for MDD were associated with long-term improvements in depressive symptom severity. The greater degree of improvement in the PT arm at follow-up on psychosocial functioning, meaning in life, and psychological connectedness suggests warrant future research. However, these results are descriptive and should be interpreted with caution. Key limitations of the study include its suboptimal power to detect small but meaningful differences between treatments, missing data, the potential use of additional interventions during the follow-up period, and reliance on self-reported treatment assessments. These factors may affect the interpretation of the study findings and should be considered when evaluating the results.

Participants were 18-65 years of age, in a major depressive episode with documented insufficient benefit from at least five treatments during the current episode. A single dose of synthetic psilocybin (25 mg) was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing through at least 3 weeks post-dosing.

Both letters emphasized the importance in engaging in thoughtful research approaches to ensure the safety of individuals who are administered psychedelics. To ensure safety, ethical and methodologically rigorous research must be conducted across the field of psychedelic medicine. We maintain that conducting such research among adolescents is sensible and worthwhile, but also acknowledge the potential risks associated with extrapolating efficacy data from adult trials and off-label prescribing practices common in child and adolescent psychiatry."

METHODS: For treatment-resistant depression, 233 participants received a single dose of 25, 10, or 1 mg of COMP360 psilocybin (a proprietary, pharmaceutical-grade synthesized psilocybin formulation, developed by the sponsor, Compass Pathfinder Ltd.) with psychological support.

However, individual variability in response to ketamine exists, and current biomarkers of ketamine treatment response are not entirely understood. Preclinical evidence suggests a link between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, a determinant of the stress response system, and ketamine's efficacy in stressed mice exhibiting enhanced antidepressant responses. Here, we assessed the relationship between HPA axis, major depression features, and antidepressant response to ketamine in humans. METHODS: We investigated 42 participants following medication washout with treatment-resistant depression who participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial receiving intravenous ketamine. Plasma levels of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol were measured at baseline. Ketamine's antidepressant effects were assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: We found that baseline HPA axis hormone levels did not significantly moderate the antidepressant effects of ketamine. However, a negative association was observed between ACTH and CRF levels and the overall duration of depressive episodes, suggesting potential biomarker implications. Also, a negative correlation between baseline depressive scores and age of onset was observed, suggesting that the severity of depression might be greater if it develops at a younger age, indicating more enduring stress on the brain and body. DISCUSSION: Although we did not find a moderation effect of the plasma HPA axis hormones on the antidepressant effects of ketamine, moderation effects of the brain HPA axis hormones cannot be precluded and warrants further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Subanesthetic doses of (R,S)-ketamine (ketamine) have demonstrated rapid and robust antidepressant effects in individuals with depression. However, individual variability in response to ketamine exists, and current biomarkers of ketamine treatment response are not entirely understood. Preclinical evidence suggests a link between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, a determinant of the stress response system, and ketamine's efficacy in stressed mice exhibiting enhanced antidepressant responses. Here, we assessed the relationship between HPA axis, major depression features, and antidepressant response to ketamine in humans. METHODS: We investigated 42 participants following medication washout with treatment-resistant depression who participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial receiving intravenous ketamine. Plasma levels of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol were measured at baseline. Ketamine's antidepressant effects were assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: We found that baseline HPA axis hormone levels did not significantly moderate the antidepressant effects of ketamine. However, a negative association was observed between ACTH and CRF levels and the overall duration of depressive episodes, suggesting potential biomarker implications. Also, a negative correlation between baseline depressive scores and age of onset was observed, suggesting that the severity of depression might be greater if it develops at a younger age, indicating more enduring stress on the brain and body. DISCUSSION: Although we did not find a moderation effect of the plasma HPA axis hormones on the antidepressant effects of ketamine, moderation effects of the brain HPA axis hormones cannot be precluded and warrants further investigation. Importantly, our results implicate HPA axis components as potential biomarkers for the duration of depressive episodes."

OBJECTIVES: This study investigates whether ketamine infusion, as compared to placebo, rapidly reduces severe suicidality in youth and young adults and enhances effectiveness of CAMS to decrease suicidality after acute treatment and at 3-month follow-up. We explore whether participants who receive ketamine, as compared to placebo, have decreased suicidality, suicide attempts, emergency department visits for suicidality, and psychiatric readmissions over 3-month follow-up.

The primary aim of this meta-analysis was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of esketamine on PND in adult surgical patients undergoing general anesthesia. METHODS: We searched several electronic databases and clinical trial registries to find relevant trials. Randomized controlled trials of perioperative use of esketamine adjuvant were included in the analysis. The main outcome measured was the risk of postoperative delirium(POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Secondary outcomes included the assessment of postoperative cognitive status, pain scores (VAS/NRS), remifentanil consumption and the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). RESULTS: Thirteen studies encompassing procedures such as abdominal, thoracoscopic lung, gastrointestinal, laparoscopic gynecological, spinal surgery, and modified radical mastectomy, were included in the analysis. A cohort comprising 1068 adult patients underwent general anesthesia, with 584 patients assigned to the esketamine group and 484 patients designated to the placebo group. The administration of general anesthesia was augmented by intravenous infusion of esketamine, and a comparative analysis was conducted in relation to alternative pharmacological interventions or a placebo. The application of esketamine during the perioperative period was observed to decrease the risk of POD ( RR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.66, p < 0.0001, GRADE = High) and exhibited a protective influence on POCD (RR = 0.50; 95%CI: 0.30, 0.84, p = 0.009, I CONCLUSION: The use of intravenous esketamine as an adjuvant in general anesthesia may represent a potentially beneficial strategy for reducing susceptibility to PND, with potential benefits for preventing POD and POCD.

METHODS: We searched several electronic databases and clinical trial registries to find relevant trials. Randomized controlled trials of perioperative use of esketamine adjuvant were included in the analysis. The main outcome measured was the risk of postoperative delirium(POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Secondary outcomes included the assessment of postoperative cognitive status, pain scores (VAS/NRS), remifentanil consumption and the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). RESULTS: Thirteen studies encompassing procedures such as abdominal, thoracoscopic lung, gastrointestinal, laparoscopic gynecological, spinal surgery, and modified radical mastectomy, were included in the analysis. A cohort comprising 1068 adult patients underwent general anesthesia, with 584 patients assigned to the esketamine group and 484 patients designated to the placebo group. The administration of general anesthesia was augmented by intravenous infusion of esketamine, and a comparative analysis was conducted in relation to alternative pharmacological interventions or a placebo. The application of esketamine during the perioperative period was observed to decrease the risk of POD ( RR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.66, p < 0.0001, GRADE = High) and exhibited a protective influence on POCD (RR = 0.50; 95%CI: 0.30, 0.84, p = 0.009, I CONCLUSION: The use of intravenous esketamine as an adjuvant in general anesthesia may represent a potentially beneficial strategy for reducing susceptibility to PND, with potential benefits for preventing POD and POCD. Furthermore, it can decrease intraoperative opioid consumption and alleviate postoperative pain intensity without increasing the incidence of PONV. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023453714)."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether psilocybin therapy could improve symptoms of depression, burnout, and PTSD in US clinicians who developed these symptoms from frontline clinical work during the pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind randomized clinical trial enrolled participants from February to December 2022. Participants included physicians, APPs, and nurses who provided frontline care for more than 1 month during the pandemic and had no prepandemic mental health diagnoses but had moderate or severe symptoms of depression at enrollment. Participants were randomly assigned to either the psilocybin or niacin arm. Data analysis was conducted between December 2023 and May 2024 and was based on the intention-to-treat principle. INTERVENTION: One intervention episode consisted of 2 preparation visits, 1 medication session, and 3 integration visits. At the medication session, participants received psilocybin, 25 mg, or niacin, 100 mg, orally. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a change from baseline (preparation 1 session) to day 28 (after medication administration) in symptoms of depression as measured by the clinician-administered Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) used by blinded raters. The secondary outcomes were a change in symptoms of burnout (measured with the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index [SPFI]) and symptoms of PTSD (measured with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [PCL-5]). RESULTS: A total of 30 clinicians (15 females [50%]; mean [range] age, 38 [29-60] years) participated, of whom 15 were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin and 15 to receive niacin. The mean change in symptoms of depression (MADRS scores) from preparation 1 session to day 28 was -21.33 (7.84) in the psilocybin arm compared with -9.33 (7.32) in the niacin arm, with a mean difference between arms of -12.00 (95% CI, -17.67 to -6.33; P < .001), a decrease in MADRS scores indicating improvement. The mean change in SPFI scores from preparation 1 session to day 28 showed a numerically larger improvement in symptoms of burnout in the psilocybin compared with the niacin arm (-6.40 [5.00] vs -2.33 [5.97]; P = .05) but was not statistically significant. Since the SPFI score change did not reach statistical significance, the PCL-5 score change was evaluated descriptively. The mean change in PCL-5 scores showed a numerically larger decrease in symptoms of PTSD from preparation 1 session to day 28 in the psilocybin vs the niacin arm (-16.67 [15.04] vs -6.73 [10.69]), but this difference was not statistically tested. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that psilocybin therapy resulted in a significant, sustained reduction in symptoms of depression experienced by clinicians after frontline work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The primary outcome was the incidence of POD, with secondary outcomes including delirium subtypes, duration, intraoperative analgesic consumption, operative and anesthesia times, hemodynamic changes, postoperative pain scores, sleep quality, and common postoperative adverse events. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of POD between Group E (8.5%) and Group P (10.8%). No significant differences were observed for the time of delirium onset, duration of delirium, and delirium subtype between the two groups. Patients in the esketamine group had more stable hemodynamic profile after induction and reduced the pain score of motion on the first two days postoperatively but increased the incidence of postoperative dizziness. CONCLUSION: The repeated infusion of low-dose esketamine did not reduce the incidence of POD during the initial three postoperative days in elderly patients following total hip or knee arthroplasty."

RESULTS: From 131 publications, we analyzed 14 systematic reviews, 20 reviews, 35 randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), 10 case-control studies, 30 uncontrolled trials (UCTs), and 22 cohort studies, most of which were low quality.

In UCTs including individuals with schizophrenia, 3.8% developed long-lasting psychotic symptoms. Of those with psychedelic-induced psychosis, 13.1% later developed schizophrenia. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. CONCLUSION: In summary, the reviewed evidence suggests that schizophrenia might not be a definite exclusion criterion for clinical trials exploring safety and efficacy of psychedelics for treatment-resistant depression and negative symptoms.

Participants on ketamine/esketamine experienced more frequency of hallucinations (RR, 4.77; 95%CI, 1.39-16.44) and dizziness (RR, 1.36; 95%CI, 1.02-1.81). CONCLUSION: Our findings advocate for the postoperative administration of low-dose ketamine/esketamine to avert PPD, which needed additional research for confirmation."

In particular, psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) has been suggested to have positive effects on patients suffering from depression and psychiatric distress associated with life-threatening disease - contexts with growing needs for alternative treatments - in a therapeutic setting involving fewer doses and less important adverse effect compared to that of classic psychotrope administration.

Eight clinical PAT trials have been conducted between January 1st 2001 and March 31st 2023 and are reviewed here.

Acute hyponatremia is a potentially serious complication after even a single dose of MDMA. The assumed etiology has been a vasopressin release inducing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis combined with increased thirst, causing polydipsia and water intoxication. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and severity of hyponatremia after a single dose of MDMA, underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms of action, and the potential effect of fluid restriction on lowering the incidence of hyponatremia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This ad hoc secondary analysis pooled data from 4 placebo-controlled crossover randomized clinical trials conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. The 96 participants received experimental doses of MDMA between March 1, 2017, and August 31, 2022. INTERVENTION: A single oral 100- or 125-mg dose of MDMA. Fluid intake was not restricted in 81 participants; it was restricted in 15. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Plasma oxytocin, copeptin (marker of vasopressin), and sodium levels were measured repeatedly within 360 minutes after MDMA intake. The association of plasma oxytocin or copeptin levels with plasma sodium level at 180 minutes (peak concentration of MDMA) was determined. RESULTS: Among the 96 participants, the mean (SD) age was 29 (7) years, and 62 (65%) were men. A total of 39 participants (41%) received a 100-mg dose of MDMA, and 57 (59%) received a 125-mg dose. At baseline, the mean (SD) plasma sodium level was 140 (3) mEq/L and decreased in response to MDMA by 3 (3) mEq/L. Hyponatremia occurred in 30 participants (31%) with a mean (SD) sodium level of 133 (2) mEq/L. In 15 participants with restricted fluid intake, no hyponatremia occurred, while in the 81 participants with unrestricted fluid intake, hyponatremia occurred in 30 (37%) (P = .002) with a difference in plasma sodium of 4 (95% CI, 2-5) mEq/L (P < .001) between both groups, suggesting that fluid restriction may mitigate the risk of hyponatremia. At baseline, the mean (SD) plasma oxytocin level was 87 (45) pg/mL and increased in response to MDMA by 388 (297) pg/mL (ie, a mean [SD] 433% [431%] increase at 180 minutes), while the mean (SD) copeptin level was 4.9 (3.8) pmol/L and slightly decreased, by 0.8 (3.0) pmol/L. Change in plasma sodium level from baseline to 180 minutes demonstrated a negative correlation with the changes in oxytocin (R = -0.4; P < .001) and MDMA (R = -0.4; P < .001) levels while showing no correlation with the change in copeptin level. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials, a high incidence of acute hyponatremia was observed in response to MDMA, which may be mitigated by fluid restriction. Hyponatremia was associated with acute oxytocin but not copeptin release.

A large number of people worldwide grapple with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and a significant portion of them confront resistance to conventional antidepressant treatments. Esketamine, an innovative intervention, has garnered attention due to its rapid-acting antidepressant effects. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esketamine in individuals with MDD and Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). We performed an extensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, covering the period from inception to January 15, 2024, to identify clinical trials investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of esketamine in individuals with MDD and TRD. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effect model, with the risk ratio (RR) chosen as the effect size. After screening, nine studies met inclusion criteria comprising 1752 patients.

We conducted a scoping review of the available literature regarding the aspiration risk and aspiration/regurgitant events related to GLP-1 RAs. Methods: A librarian-assisted search was performed using five electronic medical databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science Platform Databases, including Web of Science Core Collection, KCI Korean Journal Database, MEDLINE, and Preprint Citation Index) from inception through March 2024 for articles that reported endoscopic, ultrasound, and nasogastric evaluation for increased residual gastric volume retained food contents, as well as incidences of regurgitation and aspiration events.

Studies included four prospective, six retrospective, five case series, and nine case reports. The GLP-1 RAs reported in the studies included semaglutide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, tirzepatide, and exenatide. All studies, except one case report, reported patients with confounding factors for retained gastric contents and aspiration, such as a history of diabetes, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, psychiatric disorders, gastric reflux, Barrett's esophagus, Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric polyps, prior abdominal surgeries, autoimmune diseases, pain, ASA physical status classification, procedural factors (i.e., thyroid surgery associated with risk for nausea, ketamine associated with nausea and secretions), and/or medications associated with delayed gastric emptying (opioids, anticholinergics, antidepressants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, DPP-IV inhibitors, and antacids). Of the eight studies (three prospective and five retrospective) that evaluated residual contents in both GLP-1 users and non-users, seven studies (n = 7/8) reported a significant increase in residual gastric contents in GLP-1 users compared to non-users (19-56% vs. 5-20%). In the three retrospective studies that evaluated for aspiration events, there was no significant difference in aspiration events, with one study reporting aspiration rates of 4.8 cases per 10,000 in GLP-1 RA users compared to 4.6 cases per 10,000 in nonusers and the remaining two studies reporting one aspiration event in the GLP-1 RA user group and none in the non-user group.

Conclusions: There is significant variability in the findings reported in the studies, and most of these studies include confounding factors that may influence the association between GLP-1 RAs and an increased risk of aspiration and related events. While GLP-1 RAs do increase residual gastric contents in line with their mechanism of action, the currently available data do not suggest a significant increase in aspiration and regurgitation events associated with their use and the withholding of GLP-1 RAs to reduce aspiration and regurgitation events, as is currently recommended by many major societal guidelines.

The objective of the present quality study, initiated by the Danish Prison and Probation Service, was to i) evaluate the performance of an initial, on-site drug screening strategy; ii) gain insights into emerging drug trends; and iii) suggest evidence-based strategies for future drug testing. METHODS: Over a two-year period, routine urine samples ( RESULTS: The on-site immunoassay method showed a sensitivity from 66 to 100%; specificity was above 98%; accuracy was above 95%. Laboratory analysis detected compounds not screened for including tramadol, oxycodone, buprenorphine, ketamine, MDMA, 4-fluoroamphetamine, and GHB. The prevalence of drug use was in the order: cannabis > ethanol > cocaine > benzodiazepines > amphetamine. CONCLUSION: The performance of the immunoassay was found acceptable; however, the screening program was inadequate for detecting other significant substances. Based on these findings, a broader screening method will be implemented in future at Danish Prisons to minimize false negative results. The data did not indicate a trend of using NPS in Danish prisons."

This study evaluated whether intranasal premedication combining dexmedetomidine and esketamine more effectively reduces these complications compared to either drug alone in children undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy with sevoflurane anesthesia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind trial involved 198 children aged 2-5 years undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Participants received intranasal premedication with either dexmedetomidine (2 μg/kg), esketamine (1 mg/kg), or their combination (dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg plus esketamine 0.5 mg/kg). The primary outcome was the incidence of emergence delirium, defined as a Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale score ≥ 10. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of PNBC, sedation depth, easiness of separation from parents, acceptance of the mask for induction, emergence time, postoperative pain score, parental satisfaction, and adverse events. RESULTS: The combination premedication significantly reduced emergence delirium incidence (9.4%) compared to esketamine alone (38.1%; relative risk [RR] 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11-0.57, p < 0.001), but not compared to dexmedetomidine alone (17.2%; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.21-1.39, p = 0.193). PNBC incidence at day 7 was lower with the combination (28.1%) versus dexmedetomidine (48.4%; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.93, p = 0.018), but not significantly different from esketamine alone (20.6%; RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.74-2.58, p = 0.326). The combination also provided significantly superior sedation, improved ease of separation from parents, better acceptance of the mask for induction, shorter emergence time, and higher parental satisfaction than both monotherapies.

Out of 200 search results, 10 psychedelic clinic websites met our inclusion criteria. These clinics advertised psychedelics for 47 medical conditions, most commonly for depression. Only 2 out of 10 clinics described potential risks associated with psychedelic use. There were 29 studies cited by these websites, majority coming from ""level 4"" evidence consisting of case-series and case-control studies. Overall, the cited evidence quality was low to moderate. Psychedelic clinics in Ontario promote a wide range of medical indications for psychedelics using primarily low to moderate ""level 4"" evidence. There is limited information shared on the potential adverse effects of psychedelics. Our study emphasizes the importance of using transparent and high-quality evidence by clinics and clinicians to ensure safe and effective use of psychedelics in mental health treatments."

METHOD: A narrative review of the literature on the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca, peyote, psilocybin-containing mushrooms,  RESULTS: Observational research and preliminary clinical studies indicate the therapeutic potential and relative safety of these compounds in appropriate contexts, including the use of careful screening practices and complementary psychotherapeutic interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary research points to the potential therapeutic value of integrating entheogenic plant and fungi medicine with culturally attuned therapeutic strategies. Respectful intercultural dialogue across worldviews and scientific paradigms allows for the further development of new perspectives at the intersection of entheogens, addiction treatment, mental health, and traditional medicine. More interdisciplinary research is necessary in this field."

We hence conducted for the first time a clinical field study assessing a sample of patients treated by a traditional healer specialized in tobacco in the Peruvian Amazon (observational design, pilot study, N = 27). The study was conducted within a transdisciplinary and multi-epistemic medical frame, in close partnership with an Amazonian healer. We used validated self-report scales to quantitatively assess mental health variables before and after the weeklong treatment, and mixed-methods to report experienced effects. Paired-samples t-tests comparing pre- and post-treatment scores revealed significant reductions in anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and general symptom indicators. Experienced effects included initial physical discomfort, followed by psychologically or existentially/spiritually significant insights.

Due to a general disregard of Indigenous knowledge and stigma, these uses have however not so far been clinically investigated. We hence conducted for the first time a clinical field study assessing a sample of patients treated by a traditional healer specialized in tobacco in the Peruvian Amazon (observational design, pilot study, N = 27). The study was conducted within a transdisciplinary and multi-epistemic medical frame, in close partnership with an Amazonian healer. We used validated self-report scales to quantitatively assess mental health variables before and after the weeklong treatment, and mixed-methods to report experienced effects. Paired-samples t-tests comparing pre- and post-treatment scores revealed significant reductions in anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and general symptom indicators. Experienced effects included initial physical discomfort, followed by psychologically or existentially/spiritually significant insights. Our findings point to a sophisticated therapeutic approach based on Indigenous knowledge of tobacco applications, which should be further investigated. The study also contributes to the burgeoning scientific field on therapeutic uses of contentious psychoactive plants."

Observations of the rapid, robust, and long-lasting effects of ketamine and ketamine encourages further research on drugs targeting glutamatergic transmission. A growing number of studies support the use of memantine and minocycline in major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Amantadine, zinc, and Crocus sativus extracts yield the potential to ameliorate depressive symptoms in patients with affective disorders. Drugs with mechanisms of action based on glutamate constitute a promising pharmacological group in the treatment of mental disorders that do not respond to standard methods of therapy. However, further research is needed on their efficacy, safety, dosage, interactions, and side effects, to determine their optimal clinical use."

This review aimed to summarize the current literature on the prevalence of substance use among young people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and identify gaps in the current body of literature. METHODS: Seven databases and Google were searched for studies reporting on substance use prevalence among young people (aged 10-24 years) in SSA, published between January 2010 and May 2024. Observational studies were included, assessed for methodological quality, and checked for the presence of heterogeneity and publication bias using standard methods. A random effect model was used to estimate the pooled proportions for substance use among young people. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1,889 hits from the databases and Google. Among these 60 eligible studies involving 83,859 respondents were included in the review. The overall lifetime, 12-month, and current prevalence of any substance use among young people in SSA was found to be 21.0% (95% CI= 18.0, 24.0), 18% (95% CI=10,27), and 15% (95% CI=12,18), respectively. Among young people from SSA, alcohol use problem was the most prevalent (40%), followed by khat use (25%), stimulant use (20%), and cigarette smoking (16%). Other substances used by a smaller proportion of young people included cannabis, cocaine, inhalants, sedatives, shisha, hallucinogens, steroids, and mastics. The prevalence of substance use problems was higher among males compared to females, highest in the southern African region followed by Western and Eastern regions, and in community-based studies compared to institutional-based studies. CONCLUSIONS: In SSA, over a fourth of young people use at least one substance in their lifetime, with higher rates among males than females and in community-based compared to institution-based studies.

Psychedelics, such as the serotonin 2A partial agonist psilocybin, have shown promise in related disorders such as migraine and cluster headache. In this open-label phase Ib ascending dose study, we aimed to assess the effects of low-dose oral psilocybin with psychological support in six to 12 patients with chronic SUNHA. Study objectives were to determine effects on cognition, as well as safety, tolerability, and effects on headache severity and frequency. METHODS: Oral psilocybin in ascending doses of 5, 7.5, and 10 mg (one dose per session; three dosing sessions in total) were administered. Cognition was assessed via the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery. Headache attacks were assessed via headache diaries and the six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). Subjective dose intensity was assessed via the five-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (5D-ASC). The study was terminated early due to recruitment difficulties; four patients were enrolled, three of whom were study completers. Post hoc, we undertook a thematic analysis of the applicable free-text clinical trial notes from the dosing and subsequent visits (n = 22). An inductive method was employed to establish emergent themes. RESULTS: No significant adverse events were recorded. We were unable to collect data as planned on cognitive function during the acute experience due to high ratings of subjective dose intensity (mean 5D-ASC scores 37.8-45.7). The impact of the headaches remained severe throughout the duration of the trial (HIT-6 mean scores 64.3-65.7).

Patients (aged 65 to 85 years) with normal Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score were stratified by age (≤70 vs. >70) and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification (Ⅱ vs. Ⅲ), then randomly assigned to either morning (08:00-12:00) or afternoon (14:00-18:00) noncardiac operation under general anesthesia with or without esketamine administration (0.2 mg/kg). The primary outcome was the incidence of POD (3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for Confusion Assessment Method-defined Delirium, 3D-CAM) on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7. The secondary outcomes were the scores of MMSE and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The intention-to-treat analysis of the outcomes were performed by generalized estimating equation. RESULTS: Six patients who did not receive an intervention because of canceled operation were excluded after randomization. The datasets containing 426 cases were analyzed following the intention-to-treat principle after handling missing data via multiple imputation method. The incidence of POD declined from about 55% on postoperative day 1 to 31 and 18% on postoperative days 3 and 7, respectively. Afternoon operation [B=-0.583, OR (95% CI) 0.558 (0.319-0.976); P=0.041], but not esketamine, significantly decreased the incidence of POD. Both esketamine and operation time failed to significantly affect MMSE, HAD, and NRS score. There was no interaction among operation time, esketamine, and follow up time. CONCLUSION: Elderly patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery in the afternoon displayed lower POD incidence than those operated in the morning. A single low-dose of esketamine before general anesthesia induction failed to significantly decrease the risk of POD but decrease the risk of intraoperative hypotension and emergence agitation.","Y.

It has been hypothesised that psychedelic-assisted therapy may reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in patients facing life-threatening diseases (e.g. cancer). However, these substances are illegal in most countries and have been associated with potential risks. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or active comparators (e.g. antidepressants) for treatment of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers on 30 March 2024. In addition, we undertook reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We used no language or date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with no restrictions regarding comorbidity, sex, or ethnicity. Interventions comprised a substance-induced psychedelic experience preceded by preparatory therapeutic sessions and followed by integrative therapeutic sessions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies in the review, which evaluated two different interventions: psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin ('magic mushrooms') and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)), and psychedelic-assisted therapy with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'). The studies randomised 149 participants with life-threatening diseases and analysed data for 140 of them. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months, and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and in Switzerland. Drug companies were not involved in study funding, but funding was provided by organisations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy. Primary outcomes (at 1 to 12 weeks) Anxiety Psychedelic-assisted therapy using classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) may result in a reduction in anxiety when compared to active placebo (or low-dose psychedelic): State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait, scale 20 to 80) mean difference (MD) -8.41, 95% CI -12.92 to -3.89; STAI-State (scale 20 to 80) MD -9.04, 95% CI -13.87 to -4.21; 5 studies, 122 participants; low-certainty evidence. The effect of psychedelic-assisted therapy using MDMA on anxiety, compared to placebo, is very uncertain: STAI-T MD -14.70, 95% CI -29.45 to 0.05; STAI-S MD -16.10, 95% CI -33.03 to 0.83; 1 study, 18 participants; very low certainty evidence. Depression Psychedelic-assisted therapy using classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) may result in a reduction in depression when compared to active placebo (or low-dose psychedelic): Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, scale 0 to 63) MD -4.92, 95% CI -8.97 to -0.87; 4 studies, 112 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.43, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.06; 5 studies, 122 participants; low-certainty evidence. The effect of psychedelic-assisted therapy using MDMA on depression, compared to placebo, is very uncertain: BDI-II (scale: 0 to 63) MD -6.30, 95% CI -16.93 to 4.33; 1 study, 18 participants; very low certainty evidence. Existential distress Psychedelic-assisted therapy using classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) compared to active placebo (or low-dose psychedelic) may result in a reduction in demoralisation, one of the most common measures of existential distress, but the evidence is very uncertain (Demoralisation Scale, 1 study, 28 participants): post treatment scores, placebo group 39.6 (SEM 3.4), psilocybin group 18.8 (3.6), P ≤ 0.01). Evidence from other measures of existential distress was mixed. Existential distress was not measured in people receiving psychedelic-assisted therapy with MDMA. Secondary outcomes (at 1 to 12 weeks) Quality of life When classical psychedelics were used, one study had inconclusive results and two reported improved quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain. MDMA did not improve quality of life measures, but the evidence is also very uncertain. Spirituality Participants receiving psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics rated their experience as being spiritually significant (2 studies), but the evidence is very uncertain. Spirituality was not assessed in participants receiving MDMA. Adverse events No treatment-related serious adverse events or adverse events grade 3/4 were reported. Common minor to moderate adverse events for classical psychedelics were elevated blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, emotional distress, and psychotic-like symptoms (e.g. pseudo-hallucination where the participant is aware they are hallucinating); for MDMA, common minor to moderate adverse events were anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headaches. Symptoms subsided when drug effects wore off or up to one week later. Certainty of the evidence Although all six studies had intended to blind participants, personnel, and assessors, blinding could not be achieved as this is very difficult in studies investigating psychedelics. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the certainty of evidence to be low to very low, mainly due to high risk of bias and imprecision (small sample size). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Implications for practice Psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) may be effective for treating anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress, in people facing a life-threatening disease. Psychedelic-assisted therapy seemed to be well tolerated, with no treatment-emergent serious adverse events reported in the studies included in this review. However, the certainty of evidence is low to very low, which means that we cannot be sure about these results, and they might be changed by future research. At the time of this review (2024), psychedelic drugs are illegal in many countries. Implications for research The risk of bias due to 'unblinding' (participants being aware of which intervention they are receiving) could be reduced by measuring expectation bias, checking blinding has been maintained before cross-over, and using active placebos. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to reduce imprecision. As the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) currently classifies psychedelics as Schedule I substances (i.e. having no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse), research involving these drugs is restricted, but is steadily increasing.","S.

BACKGROUND: Psychedelic-assisted therapy refers to a group of therapeutic practices involving psychedelics taken under therapeutic supervision from physicians, psychologists, and others. It has been hypothesised that psychedelic-assisted therapy may reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in patients facing life-threatening diseases (e.g. cancer). However, these substances are illegal in most countries and have been associated with potential risks. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or active comparators (e.g. antidepressants) for treatment of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers on 30 March 2024. In addition, we undertook reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We used no language or date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with no restrictions regarding comorbidity, sex, or ethnicity. Interventions comprised a substance-induced psychedelic experience preceded by preparatory therapeutic sessions and followed by integrative therapeutic sessions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies in the review, which evaluated two different interventions: psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin ('magic mushrooms') and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)), and psychedelic-assisted therapy with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy').

OBJECTIVE: To assess adverse events (AEs) associated with classic psychedelics, particularly serious AEs (SAEs) and nonserious AEs (NSAEs) requiring medical or psychiatric evaluation. DATA SOURCES: The search for potentially eligible studies was conducted in the Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases from inception through February 8, 2024. STUDY SELECTION: Two independent reviewers screened articles of classic psychedelics (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine [DMT], and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine [5-MeO-DMT]) involving administration in clinical or research contexts. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: AE data were extracted and synthesized by 2 reviewers and were used for random-effects meta-analysis of AE frequency and heterogeneity. Risk of bias assessment focused on AE ascertainment (eg, systematic assessment and quality of follow-up). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A hybrid approach was used for capture of all reported AEs following high-dose classic psychedelic exposure and confirmatory capture of AEs of special interest, including suicidality, psychotic disorder, manic symptoms, cardiovascular events, and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. AEs were stratified by timescale and study population type. Forest plots of common AEs were generated, and the proportions of participants affected by SAEs or NSAEs requiring medical intervention were summarized descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 214 unique studies were included, of which 114 (53.3%) reported analyzable AE data for 3504 total participants. SAEs were reported for no healthy participants and for approximately 4% of participants with preexisting neuropsychiatric disorders; among these SAEs were worsening depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, and convulsive episodes. NSAEs requiring medical intervention (eg, paranoia, headache) were similarly rare. In contemporary research settings, there were no reports of deaths by suicide, persistent psychotic disorders, or hallucinogen persisting perception disorders following administration of high-dose classic psychedelics. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the quality of AE monitoring and reporting. Of 68 analyzed studies published since 2005, only 16 (23.5%) described systematic approaches to AE assessment, and 20 studies (29.4%) reported all AEs, as opposed to only adverse drug reactions. Meta-analyses of prevalence for common AEs (eg, headache, anxiety, nausea, fatigue, and dizziness) yielded comparable results for psilocybin and LSD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, classic psychedelics were generally well tolerated in clinical or research settings according to the existing literature, although SAEs did occur. These results provide estimates of common AE frequencies and indicate that certain catastrophic events reported in recreational or nonclinical contexts have yet to be reported in contemporary trial participants.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the relative effectiveness of ECT, rTMS, and ketamine in treating TRD among adolescents. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched databases for studies of ECT, rTMS, or ketamine for treatment-resistant depression in youth ages 10-24.

Racemic 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) acutely increases mood, feelings of empathy, trust, and closeness to others and is investigated to assist psychotherapy. Preclinical research indicates that S-MDMA releases monoamines and oxytocin more potently than R-MDMA, whereas R-MDMA more potently stimulates serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors. S-MDMA may have more stimulant properties, and R-MDMA may be more psychedelic-like. However, acute effects of S- and R-MDMA have not been examined in a controlled human study. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design to compare acute effects of MDMA (125 mg), S-MDMA (125 mg), R-MDMA (125 mg and 250 mg), and placebo in 24 healthy participants. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics, and plasma oxytocin, prolactin, and cortisol concentrations. S-MDMA (125 mg) induced greater subjective effects (""stimulation,"" ""drug high,"" ""happy,"" ""open"") and higher increases in blood pressure than R-MDMA (both 125 and 250 mg) and MDMA (125 mg). Unexpectedly, R-MDMA did not produce more psychedelic-like effects than S-MDMA. S-MDMA increased plasma prolactin more than MDMA, and S-MDMA increased plasma cortisol and oxytocin more than MDMA and R-MDMA. The plasma elimination half-life of S-MDMA was 4.1 h after administration. The half-life of R-MDMA was 12 and 14 h after the administration of 125 and 250 mg, respectively.

Building upon the known impact of anesthesia on brain function, we have formulated a hypothesis suggesting that the timing of esketamine administration in relation to anesthesia may significantly affect its efficacy in managing postoperative depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of esketamine administered at different time points before and after anesthesia. METHODS: Our randomized, double-blind, controlled study involved 120 patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery, randomly divided into three groups. Group Post- ESK received an intravenous injection of esketamine at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg after anesthesia induction. Group Pre- ESK received the same esketamine dosage 2 h prior to anesthesia induction. Group Placebo served as the control group and received a 0.9% saline solution after induction. The primary outcome measures of the study were depression scores as measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. RESULTS: On the first postoperative day, the PHQ-9 scores, incidence and severity of postoperative depression in the Pre-ESK group were significantly lower than those in the Post-ESK and placebo groups (P < 0.05). Additionally, plasma BDNF levels in the Pre-ESK group were significantly higher than those in the Post-ESK and placebo groups (P < 0.05).

Morphine upregulated CNPase whereas ibogaine alone had no effect on CNP mRNA or protein expression.

This effect diminished after 72 h and resulted in a highly significant upregulation of CNPase protein at 72 h post administration. Ibogaine administration alone significantly upregulated protein expression yet downregulated MBP mRNA expression. Ibogaine administration following repeated morphine administration significantly upregulated MBP mRNA expression which increased at 72 h post administration resulting in a highly significant upregulation of MBP protein expression at 72 h post administration.

Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five experimental groups of n = 10; (1) a saline control group received daily saline injections for 10 days, (2) a morphine control group received escalating morphine doses from 5 to 15 mg/kg over 10 days, (3) an ibogaine control group that received 10 days of saline followed by 50 mg/kg ibogaine hydrochloride, (4) a combination morphine and ibogaine group 1 that received the escalating morphine regime followed by 50 mg/kg ibogaine hydrochloride and (5) a second combination morphine and ibogaine group 2 which followed the same morphine and ibogaine regimen yet was terminated 72 h after administration compared to 24 h in the other groups. White matter from the internal capsule was dissected and qPCR and western blotting determined protein and gene expression of CNP and MBP. Morphine upregulated CNPase whereas ibogaine alone had no effect on CNP mRNA or protein expression. However, ibogaine administration following repeated morphine administration had an immediate effect by increasing CNP mRNA expression. This effect diminished after 72 h and resulted in a highly significant upregulation of CNPase protein at 72 h post administration. Ibogaine administration alone significantly upregulated protein expression yet downregulated MBP mRNA expression. Ibogaine administration following repeated morphine administration significantly upregulated MBP mRNA expression which increased at 72 h post administration resulting in a highly significant upregulation of MBP protein expression at 72 h post administration. These findings indicate that ibogaine is able to upregulate genes and proteins involved in the process of remyelination following opioid use and highlights an important mechanism of action of ibogaine's ability to treat substance use disorders."

METHODS: The study employed the MR analysis, leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables to facilitate robust causal inference. Data for gut microbiota was extracted from the MiBioGen study, integrating genome-wide genotyping data with 16S fecal microbiota profiles. Outcome metrics were based on the Finngen study. Genetic instruments were meticulously extracted based on stringent criteria, and harmonized with SNP outcomes associated with ""Poisoning by narcotics and psychodysleptics (hallucinogens)"". The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized for MR analysis, supplemented by sensitivity analyses including MR-Egger Regression, Weighted Median Approach, and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation. RESULTS: Among various microbial groups, nine showed significant statistical links. Specifically, Class Negativicutes (OR 5.68, 95% CI 2.13-15.16, p = 0.0005) and Order Selenomonadales (OR 5.68, 95% CI 2.13-15.16, p = 0.0005) were notably associated. These findings were consistent across different sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The relationship between gut microbiota and the adverse effects of narcotics and psychodysleptics is an emerging area of research.

Su","Deciphering the Causality between Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis and Poisoning by Narcotics and Psychodysleptics: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.^
BACKGROUND: This study investigates the connection between gut microbiota and poisoning caused by narcotics and psychodysleptics, using Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore possible causal relationships. METHODS: The study employed the MR analysis, leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables to facilitate robust causal inference. Data for gut microbiota was extracted from the MiBioGen study, integrating genome-wide genotyping data with 16S fecal microbiota profiles. Outcome metrics were based on the Finngen study. Genetic instruments were meticulously extracted based on stringent criteria, and harmonized with SNP outcomes associated with ""Poisoning by narcotics and psychodysleptics (hallucinogens)"". The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized for MR analysis, supplemented by sensitivity analyses including MR-Egger Regression, Weighted Median Approach, and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation. RESULTS: Among various microbial groups, nine showed significant statistical links. Specifically, Class Negativicutes (OR 5.68, 95% CI 2.13-15.16, p = 0.0005) and Order Selenomonadales (OR 5.68, 95% CI 2.13-15.16, p = 0.0005) were notably associated. These findings were consistent across different sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The relationship between gut microbiota and the adverse effects of narcotics and psychodysleptics is an emerging area of research. Our MR study identifies certain microbes that might influence the body's response to these substances. These insights could help in predicting and treating the effects of narcotics and psychodysleptics in the future."

Studies were rated for quality on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (most rigorous, i.e., properly powered randomized clinical trial) to 5 (least rigorous, e.g., case reports). Separate analyses were performed for two groups of studies, one involving all included studies meeting search criteria, and the other involving only studies from the USA.

Finally, a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the relative quality ratings of studies published before and after December 31, 2017. FINDINGS: 787 studies were screened, and 39 studies were included. This included 16 studies (n = 282) from a prior review published in 2018 with an additional 23 studies (n = 1111) that were published after 2017, consisting of 14 randomized controlled studies, 8 open-label studies, and 1 placebo-controlled, within-subject, fixed-order study.

Although evidence suggests an association between hopelessness and suicidality, very few studies have investigated the antihopelessness effects of ketamine. Methods: This study included 84 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation. The diagnosis of depression was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. They were randomly assigned to receive a single infusion of either 0.5 mg/kg ketamine or 0.045 mg/kg midazolam. Hopelessness and suicidal symptoms were assessed at baseline, at 240 minutes postinfusion, and on Days 2, 3, 7, and 14 postinfusion.

The analysis focused on the positive and negative domains of the BHS and PANSI, respectively. The clinical trial was conducted between August 15, 2018, and November 30, 2021. Results: Statistical analyses performed using a generalized linear model revealed that the ketamine group had significantly higher PANSI-positive (P = .008) and lower PANSI-negative (P = .015) suicidal ideation scores on Day 2 postinfusion than did the midazolam group. At 240 minutes postinfusion, the ketamine group had significantly lower BHS-negative domain scores than did the midazolam group (P = .031). Notably, the observed ketamine-induced reduction in hopelessness at 240 minutes postinfusion was associated with its antisuicidal effect on Day 2 postinfusion. Discussion: A single infusion of low-dose ketamine resulted in a brief (∼4 hours) yet significant reduction in hopelessness. Subjective antisuicidal effects of ketamine were noted on Day 2 postinfusion.

Background: Low-dose ketamine infusion has been demonstrated to exert antisuicidal effects on patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and strong suicidal ideation. Although evidence suggests an association between hopelessness and suicidality, very few studies have investigated the antihopelessness effects of ketamine. Methods: This study included 84 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation. The diagnosis of depression was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. They were randomly assigned to receive a single infusion of either 0.5 mg/kg ketamine or 0.045 mg/kg midazolam. Hopelessness and suicidal symptoms were assessed at baseline, at 240 minutes postinfusion, and on Days 2, 3, 7, and 14 postinfusion. The assessments were performed using the self-report Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation Inventory (PANSI).

Given the impact of relationship functioning on the overall health of veterans, improving the effect of PTSD treatments on relationship functioning is an essential area of research. One promising path is the role of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)-assisted therapy in augmenting the relational impact of established therapeutic interventions such as bCBCT. METHOD/DESIGN: This is a single site, open-label study assessing the preliminary efficacy, safety, and acceptability of MDMA-assisted therapy in combination with bCBCT in 8 veterans with PTSD and their intimate partners ( CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine the efficacy of MDMA-assisted bCBCT for improving PTSD and relationship functioning among a sample of U.S. military veterans and their partners. This project could provide an opportunity to pilot a scalable model of treating PTSD within the Veterans Affairs healthcare system and leverage the benefits of MDMA for veterans with PTSD, as well as the downstream benefits to their partner on both individual and relationship functioning.

[],38993656,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38993656/,,2024,The Black Book of Psychotropic Dosing and Monitoring.,"Introduction Since the last edition of the Black Book, several innovative agents have been approved or are poised to be approved in the coming year. These include novel antidepressants, the first muscarine agonist for the treatment of schizophrenia, the first psychedelic which may be approved for the treatment of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), and the first disease modifying drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Three new antidepressants have come to the market in the past 18 months. The first of those, Auvelity, the combination of bupropion and dextromethorphan, takes advantage of a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic synergism between the two drugs.85 Dextromethorphan has several pharmacodynamic properties including actions on the NMDA receptor and the Sigma 1 receptor, adding to the indirect norepinephrine agonist properties of bupropion. How Dextromethorphan is rapidly metabolized via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme to dextrophan that may have mu opioid agonist properties. The combination with bupropion, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, inhibits the metabolism of dextromethorphan allowing for more consistent therapeutic levels. The combination of dextromethorphan 45 mg twice per day and bupropion SR 105 mg twice daily appears to be more effective than an equivalent dose of bupropion alone both in speeding up antidepressant response and achieving remission. However, it's not clear at this time how the combination would compare with a more typical dose of bupropion of 300-450 milligrams a day range. The phase III program for Auvelity, showed that the drug was well tolerated with the most common side effects being dizziness, headache, and dry mouth.86 Another novel antidepressant agent approved in 2023 is zuranolone (Zurzuvae). Zuranolone is an oral analog of IV brexanalone, and like brexanolone, was approved for the treatment of post-partum depression.83 The advantages of zuranolone over brexanalone are many. While brexanolone is a 60-hour intravenous infusion that must be administered in a health care facility, zuranolone is a once/day oral medication that is usually taken at home. Like brexanolone, and unlike most antidepressants, zuranolone has a short course of treatment, lasting just 14 days. Zuranolone's, as does brexanolone, is thought to act primarily as allosteric modulator of the GABA-a receptors. Despite only 14 days of treatment, zuranolone produced in depression in post-partum patients a clinically and significantly meaningful improvement at day 15 and continued to day 45 or 1 month past the end of treatment. Zuranolone is a schedule IV drug. The most common side effect in clinical trials was somnolence with 36% of participants reporting this side effect vs only 6% of those on placebo.84 Other common side effects included dizziness, diarrhea and fatigue. While the FDA declined to approve zuranolone as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment to standard antidepressants in major depression itself, there are positive studies in non-post-partum major depression albeit with smaller effect sizes and less consistent duration of activity. It is likely that zuranolone will continue to be studied in other depressive syndromes such as depression with anxious distress. The third ""new"" antidepressant approved late 2023 was gepirone (Exxua). Gepirone is not exactly a new or novel antidepressant and originally sought approval in the US about 20 years ago.88 There had been two positive studies of gepirone during the original NDA application but also a number of failed, negative, or non-informative studies as well. Thus, the FDA declined to originally approve the drug. However, failed and negative trials are common with antidepressants and after much internal debate, the FDA ultimately agreed to approve the drug based on the positive trials and a relatively favorable side effect profile. Gepirone, like buspirone, is a partial agonist of the 5HT1a receptor and a 5HT2 antagonist. As such, gepirone does not tend to be associated with sexual side effects, weight gain, or sedation. The most common side effects are dizziness, nausea, and insomnia which tend to improve in many patients over time. Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) continue to be the only class of agents [other than esketamine (Spravato)] approved in adjunctive treatment of resistant major depression. In addition to olanzapine (combined with fluoxetine; Symbyax), aripiprazole (Abilify), quetiapine (Seroquel), brexpiprazole (Rexulti), cariprazine (Vraylar) became the latest SGA to be approved in 2022.90 Adjunctive cariprazine at 1.5 mg daily was significantly more effective than adjunctive placebo in patients with MDD who had failed to achieve an adequate response with an antidepressant alone after 6 weeks of treatment. Interestingly, a 3 mg dose of cariprazine was less consistently effective.91 The major advantage of cariprazine over some of the other approved adjunctive SGA's is easy dosing, with the starting 1.5 mg dose being the optimal therapeutic dose for most people, and a lower metabolic side effect burden with most subjects having limited or no weight gain in short term trials. The most common side effect were akathisia/restlessness, fatigue, and nausea. Lumateperone (Caplyta) is also has positive phase III data in the adjunctive treatment of major depression and is expective file for approval in late 2024. Another recent major development in psychopharmacology is the reemergence of psychedelics in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The first of these is MDMA (phenethylamine 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD. A New Drug Application (NDA) was accepted by the FDA for MDMA in the treatment of PTSD in late 2023.87 Because the drug is being fast tracked as a ""breakthrough"" treatment by the FDA, it was expected to see approval in the summer of 2024. The phase II and III data for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD have been quite consistent and impressive. However, independent reviews have pointed to significant deficiencies in these studies including the bias introduced because of functional unblinding; virtually all patients in psychedelic studies can guess whether they got the active drug or placebo. The functional unblinding, the lack of standardization of adjunctive psychotherapy as well as the abuse potential of MDMA, may delay an FDA approval. The typical regimen in these trials included 3 preparatory psychotherapy sessions followed by once/month dosing sessions (lasting about 8 hours) and using doses of 120-160 mg in a split dose. There were typically 3 monthly dosing sessions, each followed by 3 integrative psychotherapy sessions to help subjects process and understand their experiences during the dosing sessions. In the most recent phase 3 trials, over 70% of subjects no longer met criteria for PTDS compared to 46% of those treated with psychotherapy and placebo alone.89 The only approved medications for treating PTSD are two SSRIs, paroxetine and sertraline. These drugs effect only some dimensions of PTSD with only 20-30% achieving a remission level response with these drugs. Thus, MDMA assisted psychotherapy appears to achieve much higher levels of remission and response than has been true for the SSRIs. Since MDMA is not taken continuously, side effects from MDMA tend to be short lived. Side effects have included muscle tightness, nausea, diminished appetite, excessive sweating, feeling cold and dizziness among others. Since MDMA is currently a schedule I drug, it is likely that a rigorous Risk Evaluation Mitigation (REMs) program will be put in place and a limited number of centers and clinicians will be designated to perform MDMA assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. In addition to MDMA, psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is in phase 3 trials for treating resistant depression but unlikely to be available before late 2025 at the earliest. An argument can be made that there has not been a truly novel antipsychotic since the introduction of clozapine in the US in 1990. All first-generation antipsychotics have been dopamine 2 antagonists and second-generation drugs have involved some ratio of 5HT2 antagonism to D2 blockade. In 2023, the FDA accepted the application of xenomaline/tropsium (KarXT) which may become the first muscarinic M1M4 agonist approved for the treatment of schizophrenia.82,83 Tropsium is added as a muscarine antagonist to block the peripheral cholinergic effects of a muscarine agonist. Xenomaline/tropsium appears to be effective in treating both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In a phase 3 study of 407 patients with schizophrenia, xenomaline/tropsium at doses of xenomaline/50 mg/tropsium 20 mg twice daily up to 125 mg/30 mg twice daily was significantly more effective than placebo in treating both and negative symptoms over 5 weeks of treatment. As would be expected, the side effect profile of xenomaline/tropsium is very different that all currently available antipsychotics. There is no risk of EPS as it is not a dopamine antagonist, and xenomaline/tropsium is not associated with significant metabolic effects. The side effects are cholinergic in nature and include constipation, dry mouth, and nausea. A decision is expected in September of 2024. The year 2023 also saw the approval of the first disease modifying drug in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, lecanemab (Lequembi). While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine have been available for decades, these drugs modestly improve cognition in Alzheimer's disease patients and do not alter the progressive course of the illness. Lecanemab is an IV monoclonal antibody that targets the removal of beta-amyloid in the brain as well proto-fibrils that are also known to be toxic to neuronal tissue. When given early in the course of the illness, patients treated with Lecanemab showed 27% less decline on some measures of cognition and function than did patients treated with a placebo over 18 months (about 1 and a half years). It is not known whether treatment for longer than 18 months would show lesser or greater decline over time. However, there are simulation studies that suggest that Lecanemab may modestly reduce the number of patients who progress to severe Alzheimer's disease and require institutional care. The standard dose is 10 mg/kg given via IV over one hour every 2 weeks for 18 months. Lecanemab is typically administered in an infusion center so that side effects can be monitored. The most serious side effects of Lecanemab are amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) that are associated with brain edema and microhemorrhages. ARIA can occur in up to 15% of patients. More common side effects are headache and nausea. While it remains to be seen how useful these new agents will be in clinical practice, they do represent an approach to treating neuropsychiatric disorders that are a notable departure from the pharmacotherapy of the past half century. It seems likely that some patients who have not been able to respond to or tolerate traditional pharmacotherapy will find hope in these new medications.","C. DeBattista, AF.

We also collected information on ethanol ingestion and drugs taken. Blood samples were analyzed for 20 classical recreational drugs using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and an automated enzymatic method for ethanol. Urine samples were analyzed using immunoassay methods and a specific gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) method for gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB). RESULTS: From 100 included patients (median age 24 years, 62 females), we collected 100 blood samples and 72 urine samples. Median time since exposure was 5 hours. Unreported drugs were found in 15 patients. Unreported drugs in the blood samples were clonazepam in 3, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in 3, amphetamine in 2, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in 2, tramadol in 1, cocaine in 1, and methamphetamine in 1. Unreported drugs in the urine samples were cocaine in 5, amphetamine in 4, ecstasy in 3, and cannabis in 2. Ethanol was found in 69 patients, all reporting ethanol ingestion. Median blood ethanol concentration was higher in patients with no unreported drugs detected, 1.00‰ (interquartile range (IQR) 0-1.52) vs. 0‰ (IQR 0-0.46) (p<0.001). GHB was not detected. CONCLUSION: Unreported drugs, possibly used for drink spiking, were found in 15% of patients. Blood ethanol concentration was higher when no unreported drugs were found. GHB was not detected in any patient."

METHODS: Pleasure from social situations was assessed in a sample of participants with treatment-resistant depression from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, using four items of the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) at five time points over 1 week following treatment with ketamine (0.5 mg/kg intravenously) or placebo. The primary endpoint was postinfusion self-reported pleasure on the four SHAPS items pertaining to social situations, including the item on helping others, between the ketamine and placebo groups. In a rodent experiment, the impact of ketamine on helping behavior in rats was assessed using the harm aversion task. The primary endpoint was a reduction in lever response rate relative to baseline, which indicated the willingness of rats to forgo obtaining sucrose to help protect their cage mate from electric shock. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, ketamine increased ratings of feeling pleasure from being with family or close friends, seeing other people's smiling faces, helping others, and receiving praise, for 1 week following treatment. In the rodent experiment, during the harm aversion task, ketamine-treated rats maintained lower response rates relative to baseline to a greater extent than what was observed in vehicle-treated rats for 6 days posttreatment and delivered fewer shocks overall. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with treatment-resistant depression, ketamine treatment was associated with increased pleasure from social situations, such as feeling pleasure from helping others.

Furthermore, few studies have examined real-world utilization and clinical outcomes of TMS. This study analyzed data from a large, multi-site psychiatric practice to evaluate utilization and outcomes of TMS as well as usual care (UC) for patients with MDD. METHODS: Depression outcomes for TMS and UC among adult patients at a multi-site psychiatric group practice were examined in this retrospective cohort analysis. Patients with a primary diagnosis of MDD, PHQ-9 ≥ 10, and a visit in November 2020 with 6-month follow-up were included and categorized into the TMS or UC cohorts. RESULTS: Of 1,011 patients with qualifying PHQ-9 at the baseline visit, 9% (89) received a full course of TMS, and 583 patients receiving UC met study inclusion criteria (339 patients were excluded due to lacking a 6-month follow-up visit or receiving esketamine during the study period). The TMS cohort had higher baseline PHQ-9 than UC (17.9 vs. 15.5, p < .001) and had failed more medication trials (≥ 4 vs. 3.1, p < .001). Mean PHQ-9 decreased by 5.7 points (SD = 6.7, p < .001) in the TMS cohort and by 4.2 points (SD = 6.4, p < .001) in the UC cohort over the study period. Among patients who had failed four or more antidepressant medications, PHQ-9 decreased by 5.8 points in the TMS cohort (SD = 6.7, p < .001) and by 3.2 points in the UC cohort (SD = 6.3, p < .001).

METHODS: Data sources was PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from inception to February 1, 2024. Randomized controlled trials in pregnant women undergoing cesarean section were selected and compared to the use of esketamine in the perioperative period. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of postpartum maternal depression. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used. Data pooled by random-effects models are presented as risk ratios (RR) (95% confidence intervals, 95% CI) or mean differences (95% CI). This review was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023431197). RESULTS: We included 8 studies with a total of 1655 participants. The quality of the studies was rated high or unclear. Seven studies involving 1485 participants reported the incidence of postpartum depression. Compared with pregnant women undergoing cesarean section without the use of esketamine, those using esketamine in the perioperative period showed a 48% decreased risk of developing postpartum depression (RR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.35-0.79) and a 1.43-point reduction in EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) (mean difference: -1.43, 95% CI: -2.32 to -0.54). For immediate intraoperative adverse reactions, the application of esketamine caused maternal nausea and vomiting (RR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.22-3.81), dizziness (RR: 6.11, 95% CI: 1.49-24.98), and hallucinations (RR: 6.83, 95% CI: 1.57-29.68) compared to no esketamine use.

METHODS: Data sources was PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from inception to February 1, 2024. Randomized controlled trials in pregnant women undergoing cesarean section were selected and compared to the use of esketamine in the perioperative period. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of postpartum maternal depression. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used. Data pooled by random-effects models are presented as risk ratios (RR) (95% confidence intervals, 95% CI) or mean differences (95% CI). This review was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023431197). RESULTS: We included 8 studies with a total of 1655 participants. The quality of the studies was rated high or unclear. Seven studies involving 1485 participants reported the incidence of postpartum depression. Compared with pregnant women undergoing cesarean section without the use of esketamine, those using esketamine in the perioperative period showed a 48% decreased risk of developing postpartum depression (RR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.35-0.79) and a 1.43-point reduction in EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) (mean difference: -1.43, 95% CI: -2.32 to -0.54). For immediate intraoperative adverse reactions, the application of esketamine caused maternal nausea and vomiting (RR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.22-3.81), dizziness (RR: 6.11, 95% CI: 1.49-24.98), and hallucinations (RR: 6.83, 95% CI: 1.57-29.68) compared to no esketamine use. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative use of esketamine in pregnant women undergoing cesarean section may reduce postpartum depression and increase intraoperative adverse reactions, but has no significant effect on postoperative adverse reactions."

However, the implication of the MDMA provocation test in clinical practice might be challenging. Glucagon effectively stimulates vasopressinergic neurons with a strong increase in plasma copeptin. We therefore hypothesized that this provocation test might also stimulate OT. METHODS: This is a predefined secondary analysis of a prospective double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over trial involving ten patients with AVP deficiency and ten sex- and body-mass index-matched healthy participants at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Each participant underwent the glucagon test (s.c. injection of 1 mg glucagon) and placebo test (s.c. injection of 0.9% normal saline). Plasma OT levels were measured at baseline, 60, 120 and 180 min after injection. The primary objective was to determine whether glucagon stimulates OT and whether OT levels differ between patients with AVP deficiency and healthy participants. The primary outcome (maximum change in OT within 180 min) was compared between groups and conditions using a linear mixed effects model. RESULTS: In healthy participants, the median OT at baseline was 82.7 pg/ml [62.3-94.3] and slightly increased to a maximum of 93.3 pg/ml [87.2-121.1] after injection of glucagon, resulting in a change increase of 24.9 pg/ml [5.1-27.8].

Eighteen children experienced ED in PACU, (3, 2, 2, and 11 children in Groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively). Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores were significantly different at all times.

In the overall population, ketamine was not non-inferior to ECT in response rate (RD -0.10; 95 % CI -0.26 to 0.05; p = 0.198; I2 = 72 %). The ECT group had a higher reduction in depression scores, but without difference in remission and relapse rates. Regarding safety outcomes, ketamine had better posttreatment cognition scores and reduced muscle pain rate compared with ECT, albeit with an increased rate of dissociative symptoms. In a subanalysis with only inpatients, ketamine was inferior to ECT in response rate (RD -0.15; 95 % CI -0.27 to -0.03; p = 0.014; I2 = 25 %), remission, and change in depression scores. These findings support the use of ECT over ketamine for inpatients. Further RCTs are warranted to clarify the comparative effect of these treatments for outpatients."

This is the first study to use MRI to follow functional changes in brain activity in response to different doses of lysergic acid diethylamide in fully awake, drug-naive rats. We hypothesized that lysergic acid diethylamide would show a dose-dependent increase in activity in the prefrontal cortex and thalamus while decreasing hippocampal activity. Female and male rats were given intraperitoneal injections of vehicle or lysergic acid diethylamide in doses of 10 or 100 µg/kg while fully awake during the imaging session. Changes in blood oxygen level-dependent signal were recorded over a 30-min window. Approximately 45-min post-injection data for resting-state functional connectivity were collected. All data were registered to rat 3D MRI atlas with 173 brain regions providing site-specific increases and decreases in global brain activity and changes in functional connectivity. Treatment with lysergic acid diethylamide resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in negative blood oxygen level-dependent signal. The areas most affected were the primary olfactory system, prefrontal cortex, thalamus and hippocampus. This was observed in both the number of voxels affected in these brains regions and the changes in blood oxygen level-dependent signal over time. However, there was a significant increase in functional connectivity between the thalamus and somatosensory cortex and the cerebellar nuclei and the surrounding brainstem areas. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was an acute dose-dependent increase in negative blood oxygen level-dependent signal that can be interpreted as a decrease in brain activity, a finding that agrees with much of the behavioural data from preclinical studies. The enhanced connectivity between thalamus and sensorimotor cortices is consistent with the human literature looking at lysergic acid diethylamide treatments in healthy human volunteers. The unexpected finding that lysergic acid diethylamide enhances connectivity to the cerebellar nuclei raises an interesting question concerning the role of this brain region in the psychotomimetic effects of hallucinogens.","A.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, medical records of patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent elective thoracic surgery from January 2019 to August 2023 were reviewed. Patients were categorized into S-ketamine and Control groups based on intraoperative S-ketamine exposure. POD was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), while cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post-surgery. Intraoperative and postoperative parameters, including hemodynamic stability, blood loss, pain scores, and ICU stay length, were also recorded. RESULTS: The study comprised 140 participants, with 70 in each group. The S-ketamine group demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of POD at 7 days post-surgery (12.0% vs. 26.7%, P < 0.001), and reduced POCD at 1 month (18.7% vs. 36.0%, P < 0.05) and 6 months (10.7% vs. 21.3%, P < 0.05).

After duplicates removal, study selection was conducted considering pre-specified criteria. Data extraction was then performed. The quality assessment of the studies was carried out using the Cochrane Collaboration tools for randomized (RoB 2.0) and non-randomized (ROBINS-I) controlled trials. RESULTS: Twenty articles were included, with 18 targeting healthy adults and two adults with depression. Results point to impairments within attentional and inhibitory processes, and improvements in the domains of creativity and social cognition in healthy individuals. In the population with depression, only cognitive flexibility and emotional recognition were affected, both being enhanced. The comparison of outcomes from both populations proved limited.

INTRODUCTION: Psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonergic agonist in some mushroom species, has shown promise as a novel, fast-acting pharmacotherapy seeking to overcome the limitations of conventional first-line antidepressants. Studying psilocybin effects on cognition and emotional processing may help to clarify the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of psilocybin and may also support studies with people suffering from depression. Thus, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current literature regarding the effects of psilocybin on these two key areas in both healthy and depressed populations.

The drugs most associated with slamsex include ketamine, mephedrone, and methamphetamine, underscoring the importance of addressing the risk behaviors associated with this activity. CONCLUSION: This study shows that chemsex appears to be associated with a high prevalence among men who have sex with men. Who use multiple substances in a sexual context, and are particularly exposed to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), indicating a particular need for STI prevention and care in this group."

METHODS: A total of 154 adults (ages 18-60) with treatment-resistant unipolar depression and lower-than-normative explicit self-esteem were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-arm design to receive one of three treatment allocations: an active/active treatment combination consisting of one infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) followed by four days of ASAT ( ~ 30-40 min/day), or one of two control arms that lacked either the active drug or the active behavioral component.

Linear regression models were used to test the relationship between group assignment, IAT scores acquired immediately post-treatment, and both acute and extended clinical outcomes (% change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores, relative to pre-treatment baseline) in the trial. RESULTS: The group assigned to ketamine + ASAT intervention, compared to the other groups, had a pattern of IAT scores indicating more positive self-associations immediately after treatment relative to the control arms (F(1, 131) = 3.979; p = 0.048).

Psychedelic calls more than doubled from 45 in 2014 to 105 in 2022 and 625 (85 per cent) of all calls were either from or referred to hospital. Co-ingestion of psychedelics with another substance occurred in 249 (33.8 per cent) of calls and the most frequent clinical features related to single substance psychedelic exposures were hallucinations (27.6 per cent), gastrointestinal symptoms (21.7 per cent) and tachycardia (18.1 per cent). Seizures occurred in 2.9 per cent of single substance psychedelic exposures. DISCUSSION: Increasing incidence of psychedelic exposure calls, including those reporting significant toxicity, likely reflects increasing community use. This may in part be driven by increasing interest in psychedelic assisted psychotherapy trials subsequently increasing public awareness.

INTRODUCTION: The global use of certain classical psychedelics has increased in recent years, but little is known about their spectrum of toxicity within Australia. We aim to describe calls to New South Wales Poisons Information Centre relating to exposures to classical psychedelics including lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, ayahuasca, mescaline and ibogaine. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of calls to New South Wales Poisons Information Centre between January 2014 and December 2022. We identified exposures to classical psychedelics within New South Wales Poisons Information Centre database and measured the annual number of exposures, source of call (hospital, health care worker, member of the public), co-ingested substances, clinical features and advice given. RESULTS: There were 737 calls related to relevant psychedelic exposures; 352 (47.8 per cent) to lysergic acid diethylamide, 347 (47.0 per cent) to psilocybin, 28 (3.8 per cent) to N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 4 (0.5 per cent) to ayahuasca, 4 (0.5 per cent) to mescaline and 2 (0.3 per cent) to ibogaine.

The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: the intervention group received a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine, while the control group received normal saline. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale and Beck's Suicidal Ideation Scale were utilized to assess depression and suicidal ideation, respectively. RESULTS: One hour after the administration of ketamine treatment, there was a notable and significant improvement in both depression symptoms (35.16 ± 8.13 vs. 14.90 ± 10.09) and suicidal ideation (6.74 ± 6.67 vs. 0.42 ± 1.52).

Challenging situations, stress, as well as feelings of a lack of stimulation in an individual's life are considered to be triggers for risky behaviours. Prevention therefore plays a crucial role. The aim of the study was to analyse the current situation in addictive and risky sexual behaviours in a group of university students. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2019 and 2022, students of universities in East Bohemia - University of Hradec Králové (UHK), Charles University (UK), University of Defence (UNOB), and University of Pardubice (UPCE) - were approached and asked to complete a questionnaire survey focused on addictive and risky sexual behaviours. Based on the search strategy, research hypotheses were constructed, which were subsequently developed into interview questions. The research hypotheses were tested using Pearson's test. The questionnaire return rate was 84%. After eliminating invalid responses, 157 participants were included in the survey - 64% female, 36% male, age range 19-32 years. RESULTS: In the area of addictive behaviours, the focus was on substance and non-substance addictions. In terms of addictive substances, a question addressed cigarette smoking, which was reported by 14.6% of the survey participants. This is 50% less than what we see in the general population of the same age (by general population we mean the group of people approached for the surveys conducted, chosen by stratified random sampling based on age). In contrast, significantly higher rates of university students reported the use of illicit substances - marijuana, sedatives/tranquilizers without a doctor's prescription, cocaine, or hallucinogens compared to the age-matched general population. In the area of risky sexual behaviours, a question was included       about sexual intercourse with casual acquaintances. It was experienced by one in four respondents. In 83.3%, this behaviour was influenced by the use of an addictive substance. The survey pointed to the high rates of salutoprotective factors (e.g. interest in sports was reported by 87.9% of respondents). Perceived social support from friends (reported by 74.5% of respondents) or family (reported by 72.6% of respondents) is a preventive factor for risky behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of the survey was to determine the prevalence of high-risk addictive and sexual behaviours among university students and possible prevention measures. Salutoprotective factors during increased stress or awareness of social support seem to be of benefit. We assumed a protective effect of higher education, but this survey did not show it. On the contrary, the stress induced by university studies and the pressure on academic performance appeared to be a risk factor.

These include acute dissociative effects of parenteral ketamine, high relapse rates following ketamine dosing and the uncertain role of psychotherapy. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) seeks to establish the feasibility of evaluating repeated oral doses of ketamine and behavioural activation therapy (BAT), compared with ketamine treatment alone, for TR-MDD. We also aim to compare relapse rates between treatment arms to determine the effect size of adding BAT to oral ketamine. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospectively registered, two-centre, single-blind RCT. We aim to recruit 60 participants with TR-MDD aged between 18 and 65 years. Participants will be randomised to 8 weeks of oral ketamine and BAT, or 8 weeks of oral ketamine alone. Feasibility will be assessed by tracking attendance for ketamine and BAT, acceptability of treatment measures and retention to the study follow-up protocol. The primary efficacy outcome measure is the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) measured weekly during treatment and fortnightly during 12 weeks of follow-up. Other outcome measures will assess the tolerability of ketamine and BAT, cognition and activity (using actigraphy).

Glue","Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of ketamine versus ketamine and behavioural activation therapy for adults with treatment-resistant depression in the community.^
INTRODUCTION: Although short-term benefits follow parenteral ketamine for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TR-MDD), there are challenges that prevent routine use of ketamine by clinicians. These include acute dissociative effects of parenteral ketamine, high relapse rates following ketamine dosing and the uncertain role of psychotherapy. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) seeks to establish the feasibility of evaluating repeated oral doses of ketamine and behavioural activation therapy (BAT), compared with ketamine treatment alone, for TR-MDD. We also aim to compare relapse rates between treatment arms to determine the effect size of adding BAT to oral ketamine. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospectively registered, two-centre, single-blind RCT. We aim to recruit 60 participants with TR-MDD aged between 18 and 65 years. Participants will be randomised to 8 weeks of oral ketamine and BAT, or 8 weeks of oral ketamine alone. Feasibility will be assessed by tracking attendance for ketamine and BAT, acceptability of treatment measures and retention to the study follow-up protocol. The primary efficacy outcome measure is the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) measured weekly during treatment and fortnightly during 12 weeks of follow-up. Other outcome measures will assess the tolerability of ketamine and BAT, cognition and activity (using actigraphy). Participants will be categorised as non-responders, responders, remitters and relapsed during follow-up. MADRS scores will be analysed using a linear mixed model. For a definitive follow-up RCT study to be recommended, the recruitment expectations will be met and efficacy outcomes consistent with a >20% reduction in relapse rates favouring the BAT and ketamine arm will be achieved.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases of published literature (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and PsycInfo) and four databases of unpublished and international literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and PsycEXTRA), and handsearching of reference lists, conference proceedings, and abstracts. DATA SYNTHESIS AND STUDY QUALITY: Information on potential treatment effect moderators was extracted, including depression type (primary or secondary), previous use of psychedelics, psilocybin dosage, type of outcome measure (clinician rated or self-reported), and personal characteristics (eg, age, sex). Data were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis model, and observed heterogeneity and the effect of covariates were investigated with subgroup analyses and metaregression. Hedges’ g was used as a measure of treatment effect size, to account for small sample effects and substantial differences between the included studies’ sample sizes. Study quality was appraised using Cochrane’s Risk of Bias 2 tool, and the quality of the aggregated evidence was evaluated using GRADE guidelines. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised trials in which psilocybin was administered as a standalone treatment for adults with clinically significant symptoms of depression and change in symptoms was measured using a validated clinician rated or self-report scale. Studies with directive psychotherapy were included if the psychotherapeutic component was present in both experimental and control conditions. Participants with depression regardless of comorbidities (eg, cancer) were eligible. RESULTS: Meta-analysis on 436 participants (228 female participants), average age 36-60 years, from seven of the nine included studies showed a significant benefit of psilocybin (Hedges’ g=0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.86, P<0.001) on change in depression scores compared with comparator treatment. Exploratory subgroup analyses and metaregressions indicated that having secondary depression (Hedges’ g=0.88, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.33), being assessed with self-report depression scales such as the Beck depression inventory (0.88, 0.42 to 1.33), and older age and previous use of psychedelics (metaregression coefficient 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.23 and 6.00, 2.48 to 9.53, respectively) were correlated with greater improvements in symptoms. All studies had a moderate risk of bias, but the change from baseline metric was associated with low heterogeneity and a statistically non-significant risk of small study bias, resulting in a moderate certainty of evidence rating. CONCLUSION: Treatment effects of psilocybin were significantly larger among patients with secondary depression, when self-report scales were used to measure symptoms of depression, and when participants had previously used psychedelics.

A clear dose-response relationship was established, indicating that higher doses of ketamine were associated with more significant improvements in depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and overall functionality. Follow-up assessments suggested that these improvements were sustained over time. The subcutaneous administration of ketamine was generally well-tolerated, with minor and short-lived side effects. The study posits that subcutaneous ketamine may present a promising solution for treating severe depression accompanied by suicidal tendencies, particularly considering its positive influence on patient functionality and well-being. This method could offer a cost-effective and accessible treatment alternative, especially relevant in settings with limited resources.

METHODS: This study included 140 parturients who underwent cesarean section in The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University (from May 2021 to May 2022). The participants were divided into two groups: the control group and the study group, based on random allocation. The control group received traditional treatment and routine nursing care, while the study group received esketamine combined with comprehensive nursing intervention. Postoperative pain, postpartum depression, and quality of life were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and SF-36 questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: The two groups had no significant differences in baseline data (P > .05). The postoperative VAS scores of the study group (1.86 ± 0.65) were lower than those of the control group (3.04 ± 0.79) (P < .05). The postoperative EPDS scores of the study group (5.23 ± 1.07) were lower than those of the control group (8.11 ± 1.84) (P < .05). The postoperative physiological recovery of the study group was superior to that of the control group (P < .05). The postoperative SF-36 scores of the study group were higher than those of the control group (P < .05). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The combined use of esketamine and comprehensive nursing in cesarean sections offers practical benefits for patient care. Notably, it leads to reduced postoperative pain, as indicated by lower VAS scores, promising improved satisfaction for parturients. The intervention also demonstrates a positive impact on postpartum mental health, with lower EPDS scores suggesting potential benefits in alleviating depression. Moreover, the observed accelerated physiological recovery in the study group, along with shorter hospital stays, signifies efficiency gains in healthcare delivery. This not only optimizes resource utilization but also contributes to an enhanced overall recovery experience for women undergoing cesarean sections. CONCLUSION: The application of esketamine combined with comprehensive nursing intervention after cesarean section has a positive impact on the pain relief, postpartum depression, and quality of life of parturients.

During disease development, breast cancer patients suffer anxious and depressed, which may lead to worse quality of life or even higher mortality. Esketamine has been regarded as an antidepressant in breast cancer patients with mild or moderate depression. Here, we wonder whether the administration of esketamine could reduce the postoperative depressive symptom score of breast cancer patients who have no preoperative depression. METHODS: A total of 64 patients treated with unilateral modified radical mastectomy were randomly divided into an experimental group (esketamine group, Group E) and a control group (Group C), with 32 cases in each one. After anesthesia induction, Group C received 0.2 ml/kg of normal saline intravenously and Group E was administered 0.2 mg/kg intravenous esketamine. The primary outcome was the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. The secondary outcomes included the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for pain, inflammatory markers, perioperative-related indicators, and the incidence of postoperative delirium, nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: The PHQ-9 score on postoperative day (POD) 1 in Group E declined from the preoperative level, while the score in Group C was higher than before, and the former was far lower than the latter (P = 0.047). There is no statistically significant difference in PHQ-9 scores between Group E and Group C on POD 3, 7, and 30. Moreover, the postoperative leukocyte level of Group E was higher than that of Group C, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: A single subanesthetic dose of esketamine can result in lower postoperative score on subthreshold depressive symptoms compared to the Group C on POD 1, without increasing the occurrence of postoperative adverse reactions.

During disease development, breast cancer patients suffer anxious and depressed, which may lead to worse quality of life or even higher mortality. Esketamine has been regarded as an antidepressant in breast cancer patients with mild or moderate depression. Here, we wonder whether the administration of esketamine could reduce the postoperative depressive symptom score of breast cancer patients who have no preoperative depression. METHODS: A total of 64 patients treated with unilateral modified radical mastectomy were randomly divided into an experimental group (esketamine group, Group E) and a control group (Group C), with 32 cases in each one. After anesthesia induction, Group C received 0.2 ml/kg of normal saline intravenously and Group E was administered 0.2 mg/kg intravenous esketamine. The primary outcome was the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. The secondary outcomes included the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for pain, inflammatory markers, perioperative-related indicators, and the incidence of postoperative delirium, nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: The PHQ-9 score on postoperative day (POD) 1 in Group E declined from the preoperative level, while the score in Group C was higher than before, and the former was far lower than the latter (P = 0.047). There is no statistically significant difference in PHQ-9 scores between Group E and Group C on POD 3, 7, and 30. Moreover, the postoperative leukocyte level of Group E was higher than that of Group C, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: A single subanesthetic dose of esketamine can result in lower postoperative score on subthreshold depressive symptoms compared to the Group C on POD 1, without increasing the occurrence of postoperative adverse reactions.

However, inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine's molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects. METHODS: We conducted a single-blind placebo-controlled study, with participants blinded to their treatment condition. 40 healthy participants received acute ketamine (initial bolus 0.23 mg/kg, continuous infusion 0.58 mg/kg/hr). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets. RESULTS: We found that: (i) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability; (ii) ketamine's data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not; and (iii) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine. They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry.

RESULTS: We found that: (i) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability; (ii) ketamine's data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not; and (iii) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine. They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency and characteristics of adverse events following pre-hospital ketamine administration for HDSA. METHODS: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) records from four agencies were searched for prehospital ketamine administration. Cases were included if a 250 mg dose of ketamine was administered on standing order to an adult patient for clinical signs consistent with HDSA. Protocols allowed for a second 250 mg dose of ketamine if the first dose was not effective. Both the 250 mg initial dose and the total prehospital dose were analyzed for weight based dosing and adverse events. RESULTS: Review of 132 cases revealed 60 cases that met inclusion criteria.

The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed with both bioanalytical methods were comparable. In conclusion, the enantioselective method is useful for the simultaneous quantification of both enantiomers in subjects treated with racemic MDMA. However, as MDMA and MDA do not undergo chiral inversion, enantioselective separation is not necessary in subjects treated with only one of the enantiomers."

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for publications available between 1966 and November 30, 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, double-blind clinical trials that reported adverse effects of psilocybin in patients treated for depression and anxiety were screened. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were independently extracted by 2 authors and verified by 2 additional authors following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. The inverse variance method with the Hartung-Knapp adjustment for the random-effects model was used, with a continuity correction of 0.5 for studies with 0 cell frequencies. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by sequentially removing 1 study at a time to assess the robustness of the results. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was considered as the adverse effects of psilocybin at high and moderate (ie, therapeutic) dose regimens and compared with placebo, low-dose psilocybin, or other comparator in the treatment of depression and/or anxiety.

OBJECTIVE: To describe pre-implantation baseline clinical characteristics and treatment history of patients with unipolar, major depressive disorder (MDD), overall and as a function of exposure to interventional psychiatric treatments (INTs), including electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and esketamine. METHODS: Medical, psychiatric, and treatment records were reviewed by study investigators and an independent Study Eligibility Committee prior to study qualification. Clinical characteristics and treatment history (using Antidepressant Treatment History [Short] Form) were compared in those qualified (N = 493) versus not qualified (N = 228) for RECOVER, and among the qualified group as a function of exposure to INTs during the current major depressive episode (MDE). RESULTS: Unipolar MDD patients who qualified for RECOVER had marked TRD (median of 11.0 lifetime failed antidepressant treatments), severe disability (median WHODAS score of 50.0), and high rate of baseline suicidality (77% suicidal ideation, 40% previous suicide attempts). Overall, 71% had received at least one INT. Compared to the no INT group, INT recipients were younger and more severely depressed (QIDS-C, QIDS-SR), had greater suicidal ideation, earlier diagnosis of MDD, and failed more antidepressant medication trials. CONCLUSIONS: RECOVER-qualified unipolar patients had marked TRD and marked treatment resistance with most failing one or more prior INTs.

Rush","Clinical characteristics and treatment exposure of patients with marked treatment-resistant unipolar major depressive disorder: A RECOVER trial report.^
BACKGROUND: RECOVER is a randomized sham-controlled trial of vagus nerve stimulation and the largest such trial conducted with a psychiatric neuromodulation intervention. OBJECTIVE: To describe pre-implantation baseline clinical characteristics and treatment history of patients with unipolar, major depressive disorder (MDD), overall and as a function of exposure to interventional psychiatric treatments (INTs), including electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and esketamine. METHODS: Medical, psychiatric, and treatment records were reviewed by study investigators and an independent Study Eligibility Committee prior to study qualification. Clinical characteristics and treatment history (using Antidepressant Treatment History [Short] Form) were compared in those qualified (N = 493) versus not qualified (N = 228) for RECOVER, and among the qualified group as a function of exposure to INTs during the current major depressive episode (MDE). RESULTS: Unipolar MDD patients who qualified for RECOVER had marked TRD (median of 11.0 lifetime failed antidepressant treatments), severe disability (median WHODAS score of 50.0), and high rate of baseline suicidality (77% suicidal ideation, 40% previous suicide attempts). Overall, 71% had received at least one INT. Compared to the no INT group, INT recipients were younger and more severely depressed (QIDS-C, QIDS-SR), had greater suicidal ideation, earlier diagnosis of MDD, and failed more antidepressant medication trials. CONCLUSIONS: RECOVER-qualified unipolar patients had marked TRD and marked treatment resistance with most failing one or more prior INTs. Treatment with ≥1 INTs in the current MDE was associated with earlier age of MDD onset, more severe clinical presentation, and greater treatment resistance relative to patients without a history of INT.

DESIGN: A prospective single center double blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Perioperative period; operating room, post anesthesia care unit and hospital ward. PATIENTS: 129 adult patients that underwent elective non-cardiac thoracic surgery under general anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: During the operation, pharmacologic prevention of postoperative negative emotion and early cognitive disorder with 0.2 mg/kg (Low esketamine group) and 0.5 mg/kg esketamine (High esketamine group) vs. placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Emotion and early cognitive performance were assessed on the day before surgery (POD-1), postoperative day 1 (POD1) and day 3 (POD3) using HADS-A, HADS-D, Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and serum biomarkers (S100β, BDNF, IL-6, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine). MAIN RESULTS: The high esketamine group showed significantly lower HADS-A and HADS-D scores than control group on POD1 and POD3. No significant differences were observed between the low esketamine group and the control group. The esketamine-treated groups showed lower pain VAS scores than the control group at 2 h and on the first day after operation. There were no significant differences among the three groups in CAM and MMSE scores. However, the high esketamine group had lower S100β and IL-6 levels, and higher BDNF levels postoperatively, while serum acetylcholine and norepinephrine were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: A single intraoperative injection of 0.5 mg/kg esketamine can alleviate postoperative anxiety, depression, and pain to some extent.

No significant differences were observed between the low esketamine group and the control group. The esketamine-treated groups showed lower pain VAS scores than the control group at 2 h and on the first day after operation. There were no significant differences among the three groups in CAM and MMSE scores. However, the high esketamine group had lower S100β and IL-6 levels, and higher BDNF levels postoperatively, while serum acetylcholine and norepinephrine were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: A single intraoperative injection of 0.5 mg/kg esketamine can alleviate postoperative anxiety, depression, and pain to some extent. Although cognitive function behavioral evaluation did not show obvious benefits, it can also reduce the production of pro-inflammatory and brain injury-related factors while promoting the generation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

However, due to the lack of safety data on combining psilocybin with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and concerns that there may be a negative interaction on efficacy, participants enrolling in psychedelic trials are usually required to discontinue SNRI/SNRIs prior to enrolling. AIMS: Using data from a recent clinical trial examining the comparative efficacy the psychedelic drug psilocybin (P) combined with approximately 20 h of psychological support to a 6-week (daily) course of the SSRI escitalopram plus matched psychological support for major depressive disorder, we explored the effects of discontinuing SSRI/SNRIs prior to study enrolment on study outcomes. METHODS: Exploratory post hoc analyses using linear mixed effects model were performed to investigate the discontinuation effect on various validated depression symptom severity scales and well-being. The impact of SSRI/SNRIs discontinuation on the acute psychedelic experience was also explored. RESULTS/OUTCOMES: In the psilocybin group, there was a reduced treatment effect on all outcome measures for SSRI/SNRIs discontinuers compared with unmedicated patients at trial entry. However, no effects of discontinuation on measures of the acute psychedelic experience were found. CONCLUSION: Discontinuation of SSRI/SNRIs before psilocybin might diminish response to treatment; however, as we did not test SSRI/SNRI continuation in our trial, we cannot infer such causation.

The entourage effect theory asserts that non-THC constituents can impact acute cannabis effects, but few empirical studies have systematically evaluated this theory in humans. This study assessed whether the cannabis terpenoid d-limonene mitigates the acute anxiogenic effects of THC. METHODS: Twenty healthy adults completed nine, double-blind outpatient sessions in which they inhaled vaporized THC alone (15mg or 30mg), d-limonene alone (1mg or 5mg), the same doses of THC and d-limonene together, or placebo; a subset of participants (n=12) completed a tenth session in which 30mg THC+15mg d-limonene was administered. Outcomes included subjective drug effects, cognitive/psychomotor performance, vital signs, and plasma THC and d-limonene concentrations. RESULTS: When d-limonene was administered alone, pharmacodynamic outcomes did not differ from placebo. Administration of 15mg and 30mg THC alone produced subjective, cognitive, and physiological effects typical of acute cannabis exposure. Ratings of anxiety-like subjective effects qualitatively decreased as d-limonene dose increased and concurrent administration of 30mg THC+15mg d-limonene significantly reduced ratings of ""anxious/nervous"" and ""paranoid"" compared with 30mg THC alone. Other pharmacodynamic effects were unchanged by d-limonene. D-limonene plasma concentrations were dose orderly, and concurrent administration of d-limonene did not alter THC pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: D-limonene selectively attenuated THC-induced anxiogenic effects, suggesting this terpenoid could increase the therapeutic index of THC. Future research should determine whether this effect extends to oral dose formulations and evaluate the interactions between other cannabis terpenoids or cannabinoids and THC.","TR. Spindle, CA.

This study assessed whether the cannabis terpenoid d-limonene mitigates the acute anxiogenic effects of THC. METHODS: Twenty healthy adults completed nine, double-blind outpatient sessions in which they inhaled vaporized THC alone (15mg or 30mg), d-limonene alone (1mg or 5mg), the same doses of THC and d-limonene together, or placebo; a subset of participants (n=12) completed a tenth session in which 30mg THC+15mg d-limonene was administered. Outcomes included subjective drug effects, cognitive/psychomotor performance, vital signs, and plasma THC and d-limonene concentrations. RESULTS: When d-limonene was administered alone, pharmacodynamic outcomes did not differ from placebo. Administration of 15mg and 30mg THC alone produced subjective, cognitive, and physiological effects typical of acute cannabis exposure. Ratings of anxiety-like subjective effects qualitatively decreased as d-limonene dose increased and concurrent administration of 30mg THC+15mg d-limonene significantly reduced ratings of ""anxious/nervous"" and ""paranoid"" compared with 30mg THC alone. Other pharmacodynamic effects were unchanged by d-limonene. D-limonene plasma concentrations were dose orderly, and concurrent administration of d-limonene did not alter THC pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: D-limonene selectively attenuated THC-induced anxiogenic effects, suggesting this terpenoid could increase the therapeutic index of THC. Future research should determine whether this effect extends to oral dose formulations and evaluate the interactions between other cannabis terpenoids or cannabinoids and THC."

Esketamine has been considered for its potential to alleviate anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, its specific application and effectiveness in PADS among women with systemic tumors remain unclear. This study aimed to analyze the utility of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in evaluating perioperative anxiety and depression in women with systemic tumors treated with Esketamine, utilizing a large-scale medical data background. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled (SC-RPC) trial design was adopted. A total of 112 female patients with systemic tumors and PADS who received Esketamine treatment were included as study participants. A moderate dose (0.7 mg/kg) of Esketamine was administered through intravenous infusion over a duration of 60 minutes. EEG signals were collected from all patients, and the EEG signal features of individuals with depression were compared to those without depression. In this study, a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) hybrid classifier was constructed based on SVM and KNN algorithms. Using the EEG signals, the classifier was utilized to assess the anxiety and depression status of the patients. The predictive performance of the classifier was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity measures. RESULTS: The C2 correntropy feature of the delta rhythm in the left-brain EEG signal was significantly higher in individuals with depression compared to those without depression (p<0.05). Moreover, the C2 correntropy feature of the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma rhythms in the left-brain EEG signal was significantly lower in individuals with depression compared to those without depression (p<0.05). In the right brain EEG signal, the C2 correntropy feature of the delta rhythm was significantly higher in individuals with depression (p<0.05), while the C2 correntropy feature of the alpha and gamma rhythms was significantly lower in individuals with depression compared to those without depression (p<0.05). Additionally, the C1 correntropy feature of the Gamma rhythm in the right brain EEG signal was significantly higher in individuals with depression compared to those without depression (p<0.05). The SVM classifier achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.23%, 98.10%, and 98.56%, respectively, in recognizing the left-brain EEG signals, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. In recognizing the right brain EEG signals, the SVM classifier achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.74%, 98.43%, and 99.03%, respectively, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96.

Although psychiatric pathology per se does not preclude the use of DMTs, caution should be exercised when new psychiatric symptoms appear. For these reasons, among the multiple factors that must be considered when starting or changing a DMT in pMS, comorbidities constitute a decisive element."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of perioperative adjunctive esketamine administration after cesarean deliveries in the prevention of PPD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 1, 2022, to January 1, 2023, at Fujian Provincial Hospital among 298 women aged 18 to 40 years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I to III classification and singleton full-term pregnancies who were scheduled for elective cesarean deliveries. Primary analyses were performed on a modified intention-to-treat basis. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to the esketamine (n = 148) and control (n = 150) groups. Those in the esketamine group received a single intravenous injection of 0.25 mg/kg of esketamine immediately after fetal delivery, followed by 50 mg of esketamine as an adjuvant in patient-controlled intravenous analgesia for 48 hours after surgery. Saline was given to the control group of patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was assessments of PPD symptoms by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at postpartum day 7. Positive screening for PPD was defined as a score of 10 or more points on the EPDS. In addition, the EPDS was analyzed as a continuous variable to evaluate depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes included the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of postoperative pain, along with safety evaluations including adverse events and clinical assessments at postpartum days 14, 28, and 42. RESULTS: A total of 298 pregnant women were included, with 150 in the control group (median age, 31.0 years [IQR, 29.0-34.0 years]) and 148 in the esketamine group (median age, 31.0 years [IQR, 28.0-34.0 years]).

In addition, the esketamine group also showed a significantly lower change in EPDS scores (difference of least-squares means [SE], -1.17 [0.44]; 95% CI, -2.04 to -0.31; effect size, 0.74; P = .008).

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-intoxicating cannabinoid recognised for its anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects with no habit-forming qualities. Results from a Phase IIa randomised clinical trial suggest that treatment with CBD for four weeks reduced non-prescribed cannabis use in people with CUD. This study examines the efficacy, safety and quality of life of longer-term CBD treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe CUD. METHODS/DESIGN: A phase III multi-site, randomised, double-blinded, placebo controlled parallel design of a 12-week course of CBD to placebo, with follow-up at 24 weeks after enrolment. Two hundred and fifty adults with moderate-to-severe CUD (target 20% Aboriginal), with no significant medical, psychiatric or other substance use disorders from seven drug and alcohol clinics across NSW and VIC, Australia will be enrolled. Participants will be administered a daily dose of either 4 mL (100 mg/mL) of CBD or a placebo dispensed every 3-weeks. All participants will receive four-sessions of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) based counselling. Primary endpoints are self-reported cannabis use days and analysis of cannabis metabolites in urine. Secondary endpoints include severity of CUD, withdrawal severity, cravings, quantity of use, motivation to stop and abstinence, medication safety, quality of life, physical/mental health, cognitive functioning, and patient treatment satisfaction. Qualitative research interviews will be conducted with Aboriginal participants to explore their perspectives on treatment. DISCUSSION: Current psychosocial and behavioural treatments for CUD indicate that over 80% of patients relapse within 1-6 months of treatment. Pharmacological treatments are highly effective with other substance use disorders but there are no approved pharmacological treatments for CUD. CBD is a promising candidate for CUD treatment due to its potential efficacy for this indication and excellent safety profile.

Generalizability was tested in a sample of 22 patients who participated in a psilocybin vs. escitalopram trial for moderate-to-severe major depression (two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo vs. two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram). The analysis was repeated using both samples combined. RESULTS: Functional connectivity of visual, default mode and executive networks predicted early symptom improvement, while the salience network predicted responders up to 24 weeks after treatment (accuracy≈0.9). Generalization performance was borderline significant. Consistent results were obtained from the combined sample analysis. Fronto-occipital and fronto-temporal coupling predicted early and late symptom reduction, respectively.

Time-varying indicators of medical cannabis laws (MCL) with/without cannabis dispensary provisions differentiated state-years before/after laws using effective dates. Multi-level logistic regressions with random state intercepts estimated individual- and state-adjusted CUD treatment odds by MCLs and model-based changes in specialty CUD treatment state-level prevalence.

BACKGROUND: Cannabis use disorder (CUD) treatment prevalence decreased in the US between 2002 and 2019, yet structural mechanisms for this decrease are poorly understood. We tested associations between cannabis laws becoming effective and self-reported CUD treatment. METHODS: Restricted-use 2004-2019 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health included people ages 12+ classified as needing CUD treatment (i.e., past-year DSM-5-proxy CUD or last/current specialty treatment for cannabis). Time-varying indicators of medical cannabis laws (MCL) with/without cannabis dispensary provisions differentiated state-years before/after laws using effective dates. Multi-level logistic regressions with random state intercepts estimated individual- and state-adjusted CUD treatment odds by MCLs and model-based changes in specialty CUD treatment state-level prevalence. Secondary analyses tested associations between CUD treatment and MCL or recreational cannabis laws (RCL). RESULTS: Using a broad treatment need sample definition in 2004-2014, specialty CUD treatment prevalence decreased by 1.35 (95 % CI = -2.51, -0.18) points after MCL without dispensaries and by 2.15 points (95 % CI = -3.29, -1.00) after MCL with dispensaries provisions became effective, compared to before MCL.

We performed a within-subjects study (repeated measures study) to evaluate the relationship between the concentration of blood lead (B-Pb) and toenail lead (T-Pb) and circulating markers of inflammation. METHODS: We evaluated the associations between B-Pb concentrations and T-Pb concentrations and circulating markers of inflammation, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (s-ICAM-1), soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (s-VCAM-1), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on 158 traffic enforcers from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) traffic enforcer's health study. Linear mixed-effects models with random subject-specific intercepts were fitted to estimate the association between B-Pb and T-Pb exposure and circulating markers of inflammation, adjusting for confounding factors. RESULTS: Traffic enforcers were middle-aged men (89.4%) with a mean age (± SD) of 37.1 years ± 8.9 years and had a total of 293 valid markers of inflammation measurements. B-Pb concentration was related to increased hs-CRP levels. A 10% increase in B-Pb was associated with a 5.7% increase in hs-CRP level [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.3-10.1]. However, B-Pb was not associated with s-ICAM-1 and s-VCAM-1. Furthermore, no associations were observed between T-Pb and all the circulating markers of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Low-level B-Pb may increase hs-CRP among traffic enforcers. Moreover, the study suggests that Pb via the oxidative and inflammation pathways may have an essential role in the development of cardiovascular disease.

METHODS: In a semi-naturalistic laboratory study, 40 adults (55% male) aged between 23 and 80 years, consumed their own prescribed medical cannabis product. Driving performance outcomes including standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), the standard deviation of speed (SDS), mean speed and steering variability were evaluated using the Forum8 driving simulator at baseline (pre-dosing), 2.5 h and 5 -h (post-dosing). Perceived driving effort (PDE) was self-reported after each drive. Oral fluid and whole blood samples were collected at multiple timepoints and analysed for THC via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: A significant main effect of time was observed for mean speed (p = 0.014) and PDE (p = 0.020), with patients displaying modest stabilisation of vehicle control, increased adherence to speed limits and reductions in PDE post-dosing, relative to baseline. SDLP (p = 0.015) and PDE (p = 0.043) were elevated for those who consumed oil relative to flower-based products. Detectable THC concentrations were observed in oral fluid at 6-h post-dosing (range = 0-24 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: This semi-naturalistic study suggests that the consumption of medical cannabis containing THC (1.13-39.18 mg/dose) has a negligible impact on driving performance when used as prescribed.","B.

Despite the prophylactic effects of ketamine, the impact of esketamine on PPD in women undergoing cesarean section remains uncertain.

METHODS: A total of 275 parturients undergoing caesarean section and subsequent patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) were randomly assigned to receive either the control treatment (sufentanil 2 µg/kg + tropisetron 10 mg) or the experimental treatment with additional esketamine (1.5 mg/kg). The primary outcome measured was the incidence of postpartum depression (PPD), classified by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores equal to or greater than 13 indicating PPD. Secondary outcomes included cumulative sufentanil consumption during specific time periods (0-24 h, 24-48 h, and 0-48 h) after the surgical procedure and numerical rating scale (NRS) scores at rest and during movements. RESULTS: The final analysis included a total of 246 postpartum women who had undergone caesarean delivery. On postoperative day 42, the incidence of depression among the control group was 17.6%, which was significantly higher compared to the esketamine group with a rate of 8.2% (P = 0.02). The EPDS scores also showed a significant difference between the two groups, with a mean score of 9.02 ± 2.21 in the control group and 6.87 ± 2.14 in the esketamine group (p < 0.0001). In terms of pain management, the esketamine group showed lower sufentanil consumption in the 0-24 h (42.5 ± 4.58 µg vs. 50.15 ± 5.47 µg, P = 0.04) and 0-48 h (87.40 ± 9.51 µg vs. 95.10 ± 9.36 µg, P = 0.04) postoperative periods compared to the control group.

Differences in movement were also observed between the two groups at 24 and 48 h after the cesarean Sect. (3.39 ± 1.57 vs. 4.50 ± 0.80, P = 0.02; 2.43 ± 0.87 vs. 3.56 ± 0.76, P = 0.02). It is worth noting that the frequency of side effects observed in both groups was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, when used as a supplement in PCIA, has been shown to significantly reduce the occurrence of PPD within 42 days. Additionally, it has been found to decrease cumulative consumption of sufentanil over a 48-hour period following cesarean operation, all without increasing the rate of adverse effects.

Pre-clinically, psychedelics have demonstrated enhancing effects on neuroplasticity, which cannot be measured directly in humans, but may be indexed by non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) paradigms. This study used a visual long-term potentiation (LTP) EEG paradigm to test the effects of microdosed lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on neural plasticity, both acutely while on the drug and cumulatively after microdosing every third day for six weeks. Healthy adult males (n = 80) completed the visual LTP paradigm at baseline, 2.5 h following a dose of 10 µg of LSD or inactive placebo, and 6 weeks later after taking 14 repeated microdoses.

During coma, anesthesia, and sleep, complexity is reduced. During altered states, including after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), complexity is increased. In the present analysis, we examined whether low doses of LSD (13 and 26 µg) were sufficient to increase neural complexity in the absence of altered states of consciousness. In addition, neural complexity was assessed after doses of two other drugs that significantly altered consciousness and mood: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 7.5 and 15 mg) and methamphetamine (MA; 10 and 20 mg). In three separate studies (N = 73; 21, LSD; 23, THC; 29, MA), healthy volunteers received placebo or drug in a within-subjects design over three laboratory visits. During anticipated peak drug effects, resting state electroencephalography (EEG) recorded Limpel-Ziv complexity and spectral power. LSD, but not THC or MA, dose-dependently increased neural complexity. LSD also reduced delta and theta power. THC reduced, and MA increased, alpha power, primarily in frontal regions. Neural complexity was not associated with any subjective drug effect; however, LSD-induced reductions in delta and theta were associated with elation, and THC-induced reductions in alpha were associated with altered states. These data inform relationships between neural complexity, spectral power, and subjective states, demonstrating that increased neural complexity is not necessary or sufficient for altered states of consciousness.

Neural complexity correlates with one's level of consciousness. During coma, anesthesia, and sleep, complexity is reduced. During altered states, including after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), complexity is increased. In the present analysis, we examined whether low doses of LSD (13 and 26 µg) were sufficient to increase neural complexity in the absence of altered states of consciousness. In addition, neural complexity was assessed after doses of two other drugs that significantly altered consciousness and mood: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 7.5 and 15 mg) and methamphetamine (MA; 10 and 20 mg). In three separate studies (N = 73; 21, LSD; 23, THC; 29, MA), healthy volunteers received placebo or drug in a within-subjects design over three laboratory visits. During anticipated peak drug effects, resting state electroencephalography (EEG) recorded Limpel-Ziv complexity and spectral power. LSD, but not THC or MA, dose-dependently increased neural complexity. LSD also reduced delta and theta power. THC reduced, and MA increased, alpha power, primarily in frontal regions. Neural complexity was not associated with any subjective drug effect; however, LSD-induced reductions in delta and theta were associated with elation, and THC-induced reductions in alpha were associated with altered states. These data inform relationships between neural complexity, spectral power, and subjective states, demonstrating that increased neural complexity is not necessary or sufficient for altered states of consciousness. Future studies should address whether greater complexity after low doses of LSD is related to cognitive, behavioral, or therapeutic outcomes, and further examine the role of alpha desynchronization in mediating altered states of consciousness."

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of ketamine and esketamine on PPD after cesarean delivery. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies investigating the efficacy of ketamine and esketamine in preventing PPD. The primary outcomes of this study were risk ratios (RRs) and EPDS scores (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) in relation to PPD after ketamine and esketamine.

RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one retrospective study including 2916 patients were analyzed, including six on the use of ketamine and eight on the use of esketamine. The risk ratios and EPDS scores of PPD were significantly decreased in the ketamine/esketamine group compared to those in the control group in one week and four weeks postoperative periods.

Due to the recent worldwide events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and wars, PTSD is not rare. Accordingly, a reliable, cost-effective anesthetic protocol to lower the incidence of EA is crucial. Therefore, we aimed to compare three different interventions for avoiding EA in PTSD patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Participants were divided into four groups: 1: performing pre-operative relaxation techniques (deep breathing exercise and progressive muscle relaxation [PMR]); 2: administrating intra-operative Ketamine; 3: applying both previously mentioned strategies and 4 as controls. METHODS: This study was carried out on 144 adult women scheduled for gynecological laparoscopy, randomly allocated into four groups: three intervention groups and a control group (36 each). Women aged 18-45 years old, with a diagnosis of PTSD were included in the study. Patients with a positive history of major neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, or renal disease were excluded. Any patient who reported the use of psychiatric drugs were also excluded from the study. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics software version 26. Kolmogorov- Smirnov was used to verify the normality of the distribution of variables. Odds ratio was calculated to clarify the strength and direction of the association between intervention groups and control. Data was deemed significant at a p-value ≤0.05. RESULTS: Heart rate (HR) and Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MABP) intra-operative and post-operative till 24 hours were significantly lower in groups 1, 2, and 3 compared to group 4 (p<0.001). There was a significant statistical difference in the intraoperative HR percentage decrease. MABP percentage decrease post-operative was higher in all the intervention groups with no statistically significant difference, except for group 1 compared to group 4, which was statistically significant (12.28 ± 11.77 and 6.10 ± 7.24, p=0.025).

Participants completed self-report and provided biochemical measures of cannabis exposure at baseline, end-of-intervention, and 4-week follow-up. Changes in self-reported cannabis use frequency (days/week; times/week) and biochemically verified creatinine-adjusted 11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol concentrations (CN-THCCOOH) were analyzed between groups from baseline to follow-up. In CB-Abst, cannabis use goals at end-of-intervention were described and changes in cannabis use at follow-up were explored by goals and cannabis use disorder (CUD) diagnosis. RESULTS: There was a group by visit interaction on cannabis use (days: beta=0.93, p=0.005; times: beta=0.71, p<0.001; CN-THCCOOH: beta=0.26, p=0.004), with reductions at follow-up detected only in CB-Abst. Following 4 weeks of abstinence, 68.4% of CB-Abst participants wanted to reduce or abstain from cannabis use following completion of CM. Those in CB-Abst who set end-of-intervention reduction goals and were without CUD had greater decreases in cannabis use frequency at follow-up (Goals*time on days/week: beta=-2.27, p<0.001; CUD*time on times/week: beta=0.48, SE=0.24, t=2.01, p=0.048).

BACKGROUND: It is important to identify interventions that reduce harm in youth not motivated to change their cannabis use. This study evaluated how short-duration contingency management (CM) impacts cannabis use attitudes and behavior after abstinence incentives are discontinued among non-treatment seeking youth.

STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The eligibility criteria were all randomized controlled trials of people who underwent a cesarean delivery and who were randomized to receive esketamine interventions irrespective of age or ethnicity. The outcomes that were assessed included the incidence of postpartum depression and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score within 7 days and at 28 to 42 days after delivery, the pain score (visual analog scale or numerical rating scale, 0-10), the consumption of opioids, and intraoperative and postoperative adverse events. METHODS: The Cochrane collaboration's tool was used for quality appraisal of the included studies. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software, and the results were expressed as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Assessments were pooled using a random-effects or fixed-effects model. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the standard I RESULTS: Among the 11 included randomized controlled trials that used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale for postpartum depression assessment, patients in esketamine group had a lower risk for postpartum depression within a week of surgery (risk ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.62). Intraoperative use of esketamine maintained a lower Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score after surgery (mean difference, -1.64; 95% confidence interval, -2.14 to -1.14). Esketamine was associated with a beneficial effect in terms of the other outcomes, including a significant decline in pain score within 48 hours (mean difference, -0.71; 95% confidence interval, -0.89 to 0.52). Esketamine increased the risk for adverse neurologic and mental events during surgery without harming health, and there was no significant difference after delivery when compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Esketamine may reduce the risk for postpartum depression among patients who are undergoing cesarean delivery in the short term. In addition, as an adjunct to reduce analgesia, esketamine also effectively assists in pain management.

PMPS interferes with function, recovery, and compliance with adjuvant therapy. Importantly, it is associated with chronic opioid use, as a recent study showed that 1 in 10 patients continue to use opioids at least 3 months after curative surgery. The majority of PMPS patients are women, and, over the past 10 years, women have outpaced men in the rate of growth in opioid dependence. Standard perioperative multimodal analgesia is only modestly effective in prevention of CPSP. Thus, interventions to reduce CPSP and PMPS are urgently needed. Ketamine is well known to improve pain and reduce opioid use in the acute postoperative period. Additionally, ketamine has been shown to control mood in studies of anxiety and depression. By targeting acute pain and improving mood in the perioperative period, ketamine may be able to prevent the development of CPSP.

Results: The review revealed that microdosing psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin, showed potential benefits on mental health. Users reported positive effects, including improved mood, increased focus, and better daily function. However, there were also challenges reported, such as physiologic discomfort and increased anxiety. Some studies observed that positive expectations about microdosing led to positive outcomes. The studies varied in design, with some being observational, others placebo-controlled, and some relying on self-reported data. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a positive correlation between psychedelic microdosing and improved mental well-being. However, due to the limited number of controlled studies and the small sample sizes in some of the studies, the causal relationship between microdosing and mental health improvement remains uncertain.

Results: The review revealed that microdosing psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin, showed potential benefits on mental health. Users reported positive effects, including improved mood, increased focus, and better daily function. However, there were also challenges reported, such as physiologic discomfort and increased anxiety. Some studies observed that positive expectations about microdosing led to positive outcomes. The studies varied in design, with some being observational, others placebo-controlled, and some relying on self-reported data. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a positive correlation between psychedelic microdosing and improved mental well-being. However, due to the limited number of controlled studies and the small sample sizes in some of the studies, the causal relationship between microdosing and mental health improvement remains uncertain. The review calls for further research with double-blind experiments, control groups, and larger sample sizes that represent the general population to better understand the potential benefits and risks of psychedelic microdosing on mental health.

However, it remains unknown as to whether resilience mediates or moderates the association between psychotic-like experiences and suicide risk. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore the moderating and mediating effect of resilience in the association between psychotic-like experiences and suicide risk. METHODS: A total of 1100 non-clinical, young adults (aged 18 - 35 years) with a negative history of psychiatric treatment were enrolled. Participants were recruited by the snowball sampling methodology through advertisements posted in the online platform. They were followed-up for about 7 months. Variables of interest were recorded using self-reports. Psychopathological assessment was conducted using the Prodromal Questionnaire-16, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Traumatic Experience Checklist, the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire, the Cannabis Problems Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10, and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The STROBE statement guidelines were followed. RESULTS: The moderation analysis revealed that higher levels of psychotic-like experiences and related distress at baseline were associated with significantly higher suicide risk at the follow-up after adjustment for baseline sociodemographic characteristics, depressive and anxiety symptoms, a history of childhood trauma, and problematic cannabis use. The interaction between follow-up resilience and distress related to baseline psychotic-like experiences was significantly and negatively associated with suicide risk at the follow-up. Specifically, the correlation between the level of distress related to psychotic-like experiences and suicide risk was significant and positive only in participants with lower levels of resilience. This interaction did not reach statistical significance for the baseline level of psychotic-like experiences. No significant mediating effect of the follow-up resilience level in the association between baseline psychotic-like experiences and the follow-up suicide risk was found.

METHODS: A surfaced-based approach was employed to calculate fronto-temporal cortical grey matter thickness and surface area derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected from 44 young antipsychotic-naïve ARMS individuals, 19 young people with recent onset schizophrenia, and 36 age-matched healthy volunteers.

These changes can alter cognition and emotions that are hypothesized to contribute to their therapeutic utility. However, the neural mechanisms of cognitive and subcortical systems altered by psychedelics are not well understood. METHODS: We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance images collected during a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 24 healthy adults under 0.2 mg/kg psilocybin to estimate the directed (i.e., effective) changes between the amygdala and 3 large-scale resting-state networks involved in cognition.

RESULTS: We found a pattern of decreased top-down effective connectivity from these resting-state networks to the amygdala. Effective connectivity decreased within the default mode network and salience network but increased within the central executive network. These changes in effective connectivity were statistically associated with behavioral measures of altered cognition and emotion under the influence of psilocybin.

The study infusion was completed without interruption in 30/32 patients (94%). In each group, 7/16 participants correctly guessed which intervention they received. Depression assessments were completed at 170/192 scheduled time points (89%). Between baseline and post-infusion day 4 (pre-specified time point of interest), median depressive symptoms decreased in both groups, with difference-in-differences of -1.00 point (95% confidence interval -3.23 to 1.73) with ketamine compared with placebo. However, the between-group difference did not persist at other time points. CONCLUSIONS: Patient recruitment, medication administration, and clinical outcome measurement appear to be highly feasible, with blinding maintained. A fully powered trial may be warranted.

Some adult studies have begun to investigate predictors of ketamine's antidepressant response, but no studies have examined this in adolescents with depression. Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of adolescents who participated in a randomized, single-dose, midazolam-controlled crossover trial of ketamine for adolescents with treatment-resistant depression. We examined the relationship between 19 exploratory demographic and clinical variables and depression symptom improvement (using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]) at 1 and 7 days postinfusion. Results: Subjects who had fewer medication trials of both antidepressant medications and augmentation treatments were more likely to experience depression symptom improvement with ketamine. Subjects with shorter duration of their current depressive episode were more likely to experience depression symptom improvement with ketamine. Subjects currently being treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications, and not being treated with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor medications, also experienced greater symptom improvement with ketamine.

Key exclusion criteria were psychotic symptoms, significant substance abuse, unstable medical conditions, and any use of cannabis. Pre-existing antidepressant medication was maintained. Primary outcome was remission as measured by Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), with secondary outcome of 50 % reduction in Beck Suicide Scale score. Safety monitoring and varying durations of infusions were also key parameters. RESULTS: Using remission as MADRS score <10, after 3 infusions 52 % achieved remission, with 67 % achieving response. Of those achieving response after a single infusion, 66 % (22 of 33) reached remission after 3 infusions, while 40 % (16 of 40) non-responders after the first infusion went on to achieve remission after 3 infusions. Only 20 % of non-responders after 2 infusions achieved remission.

METHODS: 152 adults with TRD (63% female; 37% male) were randomly allocated to receive a single infusion of ketamine or saline in a 2:1 ratio. We examined changes in connectivity (from baseline to 24-h post-infusion) that differed by treatment, and whether clinical treatment response at 24-h post-infusion was uniquely related (among patients allocated to ketamine relative to saline) to (1) pre-treatment connectivity and (2) changes in connectivity. We examined both miFC and rsFC, using prefrontal cortex and limbic seed regions. We also conducted a multiverse analysis to examine findings most robust against analytic decisions. FINDINGS: Across both miFC and rsFC, ketamine was associated with greater in prefrontal/limbic connectivity compared to saline, and lower baseline connectivity of limbic and prefrontal regions predicted greater treatment response in patients receiving ketamine.

The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) after 2 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days following initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes in suicidal ideation, evaluated by the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSSI). RESULTS: Both groups experienced a significant decrease in the severity of depression following the interventions ( CONCLUSION: Both ketamine and buprenorphine appear to be equally effective in reducing symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation among individuals with MDD and OUD."

METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, GoogleScholar, and US and European trial registries were searched from inception through May 23, 2023, with no language limits. We included RCTs with (1) a diagnosis of MDE; (2) ECT intervention with ketamine and/or other anesthetic agents; and (3) measures included: depressive symptoms, cognitive performance, remission or response rates, and serious adverse events. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to compare ketamine and 7 other anesthetic agents. Hedges' g standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used for continuous measures, and relative risks (RRs) were used for other binary outcomes using random-effects models. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included in the systematic review. A total of 2322 patients from 17 RCTs were included in the NMA. The overall pooled SMD of ketamine, as compared with propofol as a reference group, was -2.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.79 to -0.64) in depressive symptoms, indicating that ketamine had better antidepressant efficacy than propofol.

We assessed seizure duration, stimulus dose, hemodynamic variability, and postseizure complications before and after switching to ketamine. RESULTS: Age was significantly associated with suboptimal seizures during ECT ( P = 0.040). After switching to ketamine, 32 patients (97%) experienced prolonged seizure duration. Ketamine significantly prolonged both electroencephalogram and motor seizure durations with a mean difference of 34.6 seconds (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.4-42.7 seconds; P < 0.001) and 26.6 seconds (95% CI, 19.6-33.6 seconds; P < 0.001), respectively.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 147 participants who used cannabis regularly took part in the study (n = 71 female, n = 76 male; mean age = 21.90, standard deviation = 5.32). MEASUREMENTS: The EC-TLFB was used to calculate frequency of cannabis use, method of administration, including co-administration with tobacco, amount of cannabis used (measured with unaided self-report and also using pictorial aided self-report) and type of cannabis product (flower, hash) which was used to estimate THC concentration (both from published data on THC concentration of products and analysis of cannabis samples donated by participants in this study). We calculated total weekly standard THC units (i.e. 5 mg THC for all cannabis products and methods of administration) using the EC-TLFB. The outcome variable for validation of past week EC-TLFB assessments was creatinine-normalized carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) in urine. FINDINGS: All measures of cannabis exposure included in this analysis were positively correlated with levels of THC-COOH in urine (r = 0.41-0.52).

Psilocybin has evidence for rapid-acting antidepressant effects but has not been investigated in bipolar depression. OBJECTIVE: To establish the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with BDII in a current depressive episode. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 12-week, open-label nonrandomized open-label trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants aged 18 to 65 years with BDII, a current depressive episode longer than 3 months, and documented insufficient benefit with at least 2 pharmacologic treatments during the current episode were invited to participate. Of 70 approached, 19 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. The trial was conducted between April 14, 2021, and January 5, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: A single dose of synthetic psilocybin, 25 mg, was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. Therapists met with patients for 3 sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for 3 integration sessions posttreatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures included MADRS scores 12 weeks posttreatment, the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms-Self Rating (QIDS-SR), and the self-rated Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), each completed at baseline and all subsequent visits.

Suppes","Single-Dose Synthetic Psilocybin With Psychotherapy for Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Type II Major Depressive Episodes: A Nonrandomized Open-Label Trial.^
IMPORTANCE: Bipolar II disorder (BDII) is a debilitating condition frequently associated with difficult-to-treat depressive episodes. Psilocybin has evidence for rapid-acting antidepressant effects but has not been investigated in bipolar depression. OBJECTIVE: To establish the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with BDII in a current depressive episode. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 12-week, open-label nonrandomized open-label trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants aged 18 to 65 years with BDII, a current depressive episode longer than 3 months, and documented insufficient benefit with at least 2 pharmacologic treatments during the current episode were invited to participate. Of 70 approached, 19 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. The trial was conducted between April 14, 2021, and January 5, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: A single dose of synthetic psilocybin, 25 mg, was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. Therapists met with patients for 3 sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for 3 integration sessions posttreatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures included MADRS scores 12 weeks posttreatment, the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms-Self Rating (QIDS-SR), and the self-rated Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), each completed at baseline and all subsequent visits. Safety measures included the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) completed at each visit. RESULTS: Of the 15 participants in this study (6 male and 9 female; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [11.6] years), all had lower scores at week 3, with a mean (SD) change of -24.00 (9.23) points on the MADRS, (Cohen d = 4.08; 95% CI, -29.11 to -18.89; P < .001).

METHODS: A total of 94 elderly patients who underwent thoracic anesthesia in Sanmen People's Hospital from January 2021 to October 2022 were selected and divided into a dexmedetomidine group (n = 47) and an esketamine group (n = 47) by the random number table method. All patients were continuously received intravenous (IV) remifentanil. In the dexmedetomidine group, dexmedetomidine 0.7 μg/kg was administered IV, followed by 0.2 to 0.5 μg/kg/h to maintain anesthesia, while in the esketamine group, esketamine 0.5 mg/kg was given IV 20 min after induction of anesthesia was completed. RESULTS: Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in the esketamine group were lower than in the dexmedetomidine group at 1, 6, 12 and 24 h postoperatively (P < .05), and Ramsay sedation scores were not statistically different from those in the dexmedetomidine group (P > .05). At 3 d postoperatively, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the dexmedetomidine group were lower than 1 d preoperatively; at 5 d postoperatively, the negative mood and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores were significantly higher in both groups than 1 d preoperatively; at 14 d postoperatively, the PSQI scores were higher in both groups than 1 d preoperatively, and there was no statistical difference between the negative mood scores at 1 d before surgery (P > .05).

At 3 d postoperatively, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the dexmedetomidine group were lower than 1 d preoperatively; at 5 d postoperatively, the negative mood and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores were significantly higher in both groups than 1 d preoperatively; at 14 d postoperatively, the PSQI scores were higher in both groups than 1 d preoperatively, and there was no statistical difference between the negative mood scores at 1 d before surgery (P > .05). At 5 d postoperatively in the esketamine group, the negative mood scores were lower than in the dexmedetomidine group at 5 d postoperatively and the PSQI scores at 5 and 14 d postoperatively were lower than in the dexmedetomidine group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Both esketamine and dexmedetomidine can be used to prevent postoperative delirium and nociceptive hypersensitivity after anesthesia in elderly patients with thoracic surgery. However, esketamine is superior to dexmedetomidine in analgesic effect, improvement of negative mood and sleep and stabilization of intraoperative hemodynamics, leading to better effect in preventing delirium and hyperalgesia after anesthesia."

OBJECTIVES: The present randomized controlled pilot study examines the effect of ketamine, a dissociative drug, on RSFC between mPFC subregions and amygdala in individuals with PTSD.

RSFC between amygdala and mPFC subregions, i.e., ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) and anterior-medial PFC (amPFC), was assessed at baseline and during intravenous drug infusion. RESULTS: Contrary to pre-registered predictions, ketamine did not promote a greater increase in RSFC between amygdala and mPFC subregions from baseline to infusion compared to midazolam. Instead, ketamine elicited a stronger transient decrease in vmPFC-amygdala RSFC compared to midazolam. CONCLUSIONS: A dissociative drug did not increase fronto-limbic RSFC in individuals with PTSD.

PTSD is also common among trauma-exposed adolescents, and current treatments leave much room for improvement. We present a rationale for considering MDMA-AP for treating PTSD among adolescents. Evidence suggests that as an adjunct to therapy, MDMA may reduce avoidance and enable trauma processing, strengthen therapeutic alliance, enhance extinction learning and trauma-related reappraisal, and hold potential beyond PTSD symptoms.

3,4-Methylenedioxymetamphetamine(MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) is a proposed treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that may be approved for adults soon. PTSD is also common among trauma-exposed adolescents, and current treatments leave much room for improvement. We present a rationale for considering MDMA-AP for treating PTSD among adolescents. Evidence suggests that as an adjunct to therapy, MDMA may reduce avoidance and enable trauma processing, strengthen therapeutic alliance, enhance extinction learning and trauma-related reappraisal, and hold potential beyond PTSD symptoms. Drawing on existing trauma-focused treatments, we suggest possible adaptations to MDMA-AP for use with adolescents, focusing on (1) reinforcing motivation, (2) the development of a strong therapeutic alliance, (3) additional emotion and behavior management techniques, (4) more directive exposure-based methods during MDMA sessions, (5) more support for concomitant challenges and integrating treatment benefits, and (6) involving family in treatment.

Accordingly, the present study investigated whether injections of low-dose ketamine attenuate Kamin blocking in an appetitive conditioning preparation in mice. Mice in the blocking group were initially trained with A+ conditioning (i.e., conditioned stimulus A paired with a sucrose solution), followed by compound AX+ training, before the conditioned responses to the cue X were tested in extinction. The animals in the control group received B+ training before the AX+ training. Half of the mice in each group received an injection of 16 mg/kg ketamine before each compound conditioning session and the extinction test, whereas the other half received saline. The results showed a reliable blocking effect in the saline-treated mice, whereas the blocking effect was absent in the ketamine-treated mice. Specifically, the absence of blocking was due to the ketamine-treated mice learning about the blocked cues.

Only 1% of the administered dose was recovered from urine unchanged within the first 24 h, 16% was eliminated as 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD. Urinary recovery was dose proportional. Mean (±standard deviation) durations of subjective effects were 9.3 ± 3.2 and 11 ± 3.7 h, and maximal effects (any drug effects) were 77 ± 18% and 87 ± 13% after 85 and 170 μg of LSD, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present novel study validates previous findings. LSD exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination kinetics and dose-dependent duration and intensity of subjective effects. LSD is extensively metabolized and shows dose-proportional urinary recovery."

We conducted an active, placebo-controlled trial to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous esketamine in this population. METHOD: A total of 54 adolescents (aged 13-18 years) with MDD and suicidal ideation were included from an inpatient setting and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 3 infusions of esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.02mg/kg) over 5 days, with routine inpatient care and treatment. Changes from baseline to 24 hours after the final infusion (day 6) in the scores of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Ideation and Intensity (primary outcome) and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS, key secondary outcome) were analyzed using linear mixed models. In addition, the 4-week clinical treatment response was a key secondary outcome. RESULTS: The mean changes in C-SSRS Ideation and Intensity scores from baseline to day 6 were significantly greater in the esketamine group than in the midazolam group (Ideation, -2.6 [SD = 2.0] vs -1.7 [SD = 2.2], p = .007; Intensity, -10.6 [SD = 8.4] vs -5.0 [SD = 7.4], p = .002), and the changes in MADRS scores from baseline to day 6 were significantly greater in the esketamine group than in the midazolam group (-15.3 [SD = 11.2] vs -8.8 [SD = 9.4], p = .004). The rates of antisuicidal and antidepressant responses at 4 weeks posttreatment were 69.2% and 61.5% after esketamine, and were 52.5% and 52.5% after midazolam, respectively. The most common adverse events in the esketamine group were nausea, dissociation, dry mouth, sedation, headache, and dizziness.

Theories regarding psychological processes involved in psychedelic therapy remain underdeveloped. METHOD: Participants (N = 13) mostly identified as non-Hispanic and White, with approximately equal proportions of cisgender men and women. Participants engaged in semistructured interviews about their subjective experiences in the study. Questions probed the nature of participants' drinking before and after the study as well as coping patterns in response to strong emotions, stress, and cravings for alcohol. Verbatim transcripts were coded using Dedoose software, and content was analyzed with interpretive phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported that the psilocybin treatment helped them process emotions related to painful past events and helped promote states of self-compassion, self-awareness, and feelings of interconnectedness. The acute states during the psilocybin sessions were described as laying the foundation for developing more self-compassionate regulation of negative affect.

Psilocybin therapy is composed of psilocybin dosing sessions embedded within a wider process of psychoeducation, psychological support and integration. Early phase clinical trial evidence is promising, particularly for treatment-resistant depression. However, masking probably fails and expectancy effects may be a part of the mechanism of change.

Rucker,"Evidence versus expectancy: the development of psilocybin therapy.^
Although the development of psilocybin therapy has come as a surprise to many, modern research with the drug has been ongoing for 25 years. Psilocybin therapy is composed of psilocybin dosing sessions embedded within a wider process of psychoeducation, psychological support and integration. Early phase clinical trial evidence is promising, particularly for treatment-resistant depression. However, masking probably fails and expectancy effects may be a part of the mechanism of change.

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) binds to central cannabinoid receptors, while cannabidiol (CBD) may influence endocannabinoid function without directly acting on cannabinoid receptors. We examined the effects of THC coadministered with different doses of CBD on plasma levels of endocannabinoids in healthy volunteers. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, four-arm crossover study, healthy volunteers (n=46) inhaled cannabis vapor containing 10 mg THC plus either 0, 10, 20, or 30 mg CBD, in four experimental sessions. The median time between sessions was 14 days (IQR=20). Blood samples were taken precannabis inhalation and at 0-, 5-, 15-, and 90-min postinhalation. Plasma concentrations of THC, CBD, anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and related noncannabinoid lipids were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Administration of cannabis induced acute increases in plasma concentrations of anandamide (+18.0%, 0.042 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.023-0.062]), and the noncannabinoid ethanolamides, docosatetraenylethanolamide (DEA; +35.8%, 0.012 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.008-0.016]), oleoylethanolamide (+16.1%, 0.184 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.076-0.293]), and N-arachidonoyl-L-serine (+25.1%, 0.011 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.004-0.017]) (p<0.05). CBD had no significant effect on the plasma concentration of anandamide, 2-AG or related noncannabinoid lipids at any of three doses used. Over the four sessions, there were progressive decreases in the preinhalation concentrations of anandamide and DEA, from 0.254 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.223-0.286] to 0.194 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.163-0.226], and from 0.039 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.032-0.045] to 0.027 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.020-0.034] (p<0.05), respectively. Discussion: THC induced acute increases in plasma levels of anandamide and noncannabinoid ethanolamides, but there was no evidence that these effects were influenced by the coadministration of CBD. It is possible that such effects may be evident with higher doses of CBD or after chronic administration. The progressive reduction in pretreatment anandamide and DEA levels across sessions may be related to repeated exposure to THC or participants becoming less anxious about the testing procedure and requires further investigation.

Results: Administration of cannabis induced acute increases in plasma concentrations of anandamide (+18.0%, 0.042 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.023-0.062]), and the noncannabinoid ethanolamides, docosatetraenylethanolamide (DEA; +35.8%, 0.012 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.008-0.016]), oleoylethanolamide (+16.1%, 0.184 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.076-0.293]), and N-arachidonoyl-L-serine (+25.1%, 0.011 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.004-0.017]) (p<0.05). CBD had no significant effect on the plasma concentration of anandamide, 2-AG or related noncannabinoid lipids at any of three doses used. Over the four sessions, there were progressive decreases in the preinhalation concentrations of anandamide and DEA, from 0.254 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.223-0.286] to 0.194 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.163-0.226], and from 0.039 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.032-0.045] to 0.027 ng/mL [95%CI: 0.020-0.034] (p<0.05), respectively. Discussion: THC induced acute increases in plasma levels of anandamide and noncannabinoid ethanolamides, but there was no evidence that these effects were influenced by the coadministration of CBD. It is possible that such effects may be evident with higher doses of CBD or after chronic administration. The progressive reduction in pretreatment anandamide and DEA levels across sessions may be related to repeated exposure to THC or participants becoming less anxious about the testing procedure and requires further investigation. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05170217)."

In this study we explored the effects of two oral medical cannabis products on normal bone homeostasis through evaluation of markers of bone resorption (carboxyl-terminal collagen crosslinks, CTx) and bone formation (procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, P1NP; alkaline phosphatase, ALP). Methods: This study is an analysis of secondary data from two Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of Spectrum Yellow (0.9 mg THC, 20 mg CBD/mL of oil) and Spectrum Red (2.5 mg THC, 0.3 mg CBD/softgel). Healthy participants (n=38 men, 45 women) were randomized to receive 5-20 mg THC (CBD levels varied as a function of administered product) or placebo daily (BID) for 7 days. Bone markers were assessed at baseline, upon completion of product administration (day 8), and after a 5-day washout (day 13). Results: All bone markers were significantly higher in men at baseline (p≤0.008). For CTx, there was a significant day×group interaction (F=3.23, p=0.04); CTx levels were significantly lower in participants treated with Spectrum Red (b=-164.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], -328 to -0.29; p=0.04) and marginally lower in participants treated with Spectrum Yellow (b=-157.31; 95% CI, -323 to 8.68; p=0.06) versus placebo on day 8. For P1NP and ALP, there were no significant differences between treatments across study days. Bone marker values outside the reference range (RR) were observed; CTx > RR (n=71) was predominantly (85.9%) observed in male participants, whereas P1NP > RR (n=100) was more evenly distributed between sexes (53.0% in men). These were not considered clinically significant and did not differ between treatment groups. Conclusions: These are the first interventional human data on the effect of cannabinoids on biomarkers of bone turnover. Short-term treatment with CBD- or THC-dominant medical cannabis products resulted in attenuation of a marker of bone resorption. Although the attenuation was not clinically significant, this finding may be indicative of protective properties of cannabinoids in bone. Further research over longer dosing durations in individuals exhibiting bone-specific conditions (e.g., osteoporosis) is warranted.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials have concluded that the effect of ketamine on postoperative delirium remains unclear. The present study sought to evaluate if the intraoperative use of ketamine for postoperative analgesia is associated with postoperative ED in laparoscopic surgeries. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed in the PostAnesthetic Care Unit (PACU) to evaluate patients who had undergone laparoscopic surgery under a rigid intraoperative anesthesia protocol from July 2018 to January 2019. Patients submitted to laparoscopic surgery for cholecystectomy, oophorectomy, or salpingectomy with a score ≥1 on the Richmond Assessment Sedation Scale (RASS) or ≥2 on the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) were considered to have ED. t-test, Chi-Square test or Fisher's exact tests were used for comparison. RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen patients were studied after laparoscopic surgery. Seventeen patients (14.8%) developed ED, and the incidence of ED in patients who received ketamine was not different from that of other patients (18.3% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.262). Patients with ED had more postoperative pain and morphine requirement at the PACU (p = 0.005 and p = 0.025, respectively). Type of surgery (general surgery, OR = 6.4, 95% CI 1.2‒35.2) and postoperative pain (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.2‒11.4) were risk factors for ED. CONCLUSION: In this study, no association was found between ED and intraoperative administration of ketamine in laparoscopic surgeries. Type of surgery and postoperative pain were risk factors for ED.","H. Pereira, MV. Antunes, D. Teles, LG. Pereira, F.
