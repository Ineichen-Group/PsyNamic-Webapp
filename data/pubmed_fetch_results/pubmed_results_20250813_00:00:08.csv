This study aimed to observe the effect of intraoperative esketamine application on patients with PPD undergoing caesarean section and to explore whether this effect varies among patients with different personality types. METHODS: A total of 280 patients who underwent elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomly divided into esketamine and control groups. On the day before the surgery, each patient was assessed using the Edinburgh Post-partum Depression Scale (EPDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale(SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Additionally, the pressure-pain threshold was measured. The esketamine group received a single intravenous injection of esketamine at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg (diluted to 5 mL and administered intravenously within 10 min after foetus removal). The control group received 5 mL of 0.9% normal saline. The primary outcome was PPD incidence, assessed using the EPDS on the 3rd post-operative day. The secondary outcomes included post-operative pain score and esketamine safety assessment. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in PPD incidence were observed among patients with different personality types (introverted unstable, 66.70%; extroverted unstable, 45.50%; extroverted stable, 19.40%; and introverted stable, 15.00%, p < 0.05). The patients with an extroverted-stable personality in the esketamine group had a lower PPD incidence than those in the control group (11.90% vs. 25.70%, p < 0.05). No statistical difference in total PPD incidence was observed between the two groups (35.7% vs. 29.3%, p > 0.05). Pain scores in the esketamine group were lower than those in the control group while at rest (4, 24 and 48 h) and during movement (4 and 8 h) after surgery (p < 0.05). The mean arterial pressure and heart rate in the esketamine group were higher than those in the control group during surgery (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A single intravenous administration of esketamine had no apparent effect on the overall PPD incidence among patients undergoing caesarean section. It may have a beneficial effect in reducing PPD incidence in patients with an extroverted-stable personality.

However, its effect on postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients with fragile brain function after lung cancer remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the effect of low-dose esketamine on POD in older patients with fragile brain function following lung cancer surgery during the perioperative period. METHODS: One hundred and eight older patients undergoing thoracoscopic radical lung cancer surgery were randomly assigned to the control group or the esketamine group. All patients received standardized anesthesia without pre-anesthesia medication. Esketamine group received esketamine 0.25 mg/kg during anesthesia induction and esketamine 0.1 mg/kg/h during anesthesia maintenance for 30 min. Control group received an equal volume of normal saline during both induction and maintenance of anesthesia. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was used to evaluate the incidence(%) of POD at 24 h and 72 h post-surgery. Serum concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and calcium-binding protein β(S100β)(mean ± SD) were measured intravenously before and one day after surgery to assess inflammation. Additionally, intraoperative dosages of propofol, sufentanil, and remifentani(mean ± SD)were recorded, along with postoperative extubation time, SpO RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the incidence of POD was significantly lower in the esketamine group at 24 h post-operation (3.8% vs. 15.1%, P = 0.046),but no difference at 72 h post-operation (0% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.126). No significant difference in serum concentration of IL-6 and S100β was observed between the two groups on the day before surgery (P > 0.05). However, one day post-operation serum concentration of IL-6 and S100β in the esketamine group were significantly lower than those in the control group (5.14 ± 1.70 vs. 6.03 ± 2.13, P = 0.019;380.08 ± 204.01 vs. 479.32 ± 213.07, P = 0.016). The consumption of sufentanil in the esketamine group was lower than those in the control group (28.06 ± 3.76 vs. 29.85 ± 4.21, P = 0.023). Extubation time, the rate of remedial analgesia, and recovery room stay duration were shorter in the esketamine group compared to the control group(27.08 ± 8.46 vs. 30.4.±7.72, P = 0.035; 5.7% vs. 18.9%, P = 0.038; 58.96 ± 16.98 vs. 65.83 ± 15.31, P = 0.031).

Sixty-one percent of patients were SI responders (≥50% reduction in C-SSRS severity). SI responders at 7 days had 75% lower odds of experiencing suicidal events at 3 months (OR =0.25; P = .009). Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating that early SI response to IV ketamine is associated with a reduced risk of suicidal events at 3 months. These findings support ketamine's unique antisuicidal properties beyond its antidepressant effects, highlighting its potential role in suicide prevention.

We assess its analgesic properties, FDA-approved application in the form of Spravato (esketamine) for depression, and off-label use for analgesia and psychiatric disorders. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases identified studies on ketamine's efficacy and safety in chronic pain and psychiatric disorders. The analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and systematic reviews. RESULTS: Ketamine has demonstrated significant efficacy in managing chronic pain in neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), especially in treatment-resistant cases. Mental health comorbidities are common in chronic pain populations, with up to 50% experiencing depression or anxiety. Ketamine's N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism not only underlies its analgesic effects but also contributes to rapid antidepressant responses in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and acute suicidal ideation, as evidenced by its FDA-approved formulation, Spravato (esketamine).

DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: All authors assessed the 3 reviews for includable trials. Three authors independently extracted data for all trials, with disagreements resolved by consensus discussion. Data were pooled using random-effects models. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized mean change (SMC) in MADRS scores from baseline to up to 6 weeks after randomization was used to assess within-group effect sizes, and standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to assess between-group effect sizes. Omnibus Test of Moderators (QM) was used to test whether the study population significantly moderated effect sizes. RESULTS: The study included 17 trials: 4 of psilocybin (n = 373), 2 of esketamine (n = 573), and 11 of SSRIs (n = 4014). Pretreatment to posttreatment SMCs (SEMs) were 1.21 (0.15) for psilocybin, 1.28 (0.06) for SSRIs, and 1.43 (0.15) for esketamine and were 0.50 (0.15), 1.00 (0.08), and 1.12 (0.17) for their respective control treatments. Study population was a significant moderator of between-group SMDs (QM, 10.7; df, 2; P = .005) and pre- to post-control treatment SMCs (QM, 10.4; df, 2; P = .005) but not of pre- to post-active treatment SMCs (QM, 1.21; df, 2; P = .55). MADRS response rates for control treatments in SSRI trials were 14 percentage points higher than in psilocybin trials and in esketamine trials were 23 percentage points higher than in psilocybin trials. Dropout rates for psilocybin (active treatment: 10 of 186 [5%]; control: 20 of 187 [11%]) and esketamine (active treatment: 43 of 349 [12%]; control: 18 of 224 [8%]) were similar and considerably lower than for SSRIs (active treatment: 866 of 2694 [32%]; control: 467 of 1320 [35%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this meta-analysis of control treatment outcomes in trials of psilocybin, SSRIs, or esketamine for depression, participants receiving control treatment in psilocybin trials had significantly less improvement in depression ratings than participants receiving control treatment in trials of SSRIs or esketamine. This might indicate that psilocybin's antidepressant efficacy is overestimated compared with that of SSRIs and esketamine.","F. Hieronymus, E. López, H. Werin Sjögren, J.

IMPORTANCE: Psilocybin has demonstrated rapid and sustained antidepressant efficacy, with acute-phase effect sizes often more than double those for conventional antidepressants. However, concerns have been raised that high rates of functional unblinding in combination with trial participants with positive expectations of psychedelic use might bias treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes for patients receiving control treatments in randomized clinical trials of psilocybin for depression with control treatment outcomes from trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and esketamine. DATA SOURCES: Two previous meta-analyses and 1 US Food and Drug Administration review published between March 2019 and December 2024 were used to identify double-blind trials on adult major depressive disorder (MDD) or treatment-resistant depression (TRD) that had a relevant control treatment arm and used the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for symptom rating.

Here, accurate population normalization is essential to ensure correct exposure estimates. Prior work often assumes a fixed population size, which can lead to major over- or underestimation. To account for daily population fluctuations, dynamic population markers have been proposed including hydrochemical parameters, xenobiotics, biological markers, and mobile phone signalling records. This study compared the daily mass loads of 32 population markers with mobile phone derived population estimates in two Belgian cities. Weak to moderate Spearman correlations (|r| ≤ 0.46) were found with the strongest correlation for MDMA (rs = -0.46), and the lowest for Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (rs = 0.03). A random forest regression model was applied to one city to evaluate the importance of these proxies. Model interpretability analysis indicated that certain psychoactive substances (MDMA, paraxanthine, hydroxybupropion) and the hydrochemical parameter chloride have potential as population markers. However, their applicability is influenced by sociodemographic factors and thus site-specific. Overall, their value lies in providing complementary information for multiparameter models rather than serving as a standalone population marker.","M. Quireyns, T. Boogaerts, JSP. Giraldo, N.

Wastewater-based epidemiology is an effective public health approach that enables early detection, monitoring, and assessment of community health trends by analysing human excretion products in wastewater. Here, accurate population normalization is essential to ensure correct exposure estimates. Prior work often assumes a fixed population size, which can lead to major over- or underestimation. To account for daily population fluctuations, dynamic population markers have been proposed including hydrochemical parameters, xenobiotics, biological markers, and mobile phone signalling records. This study compared the daily mass loads of 32 population markers with mobile phone derived population estimates in two Belgian cities. Weak to moderate Spearman correlations (|r| ≤ 0.46) were found with the strongest correlation for MDMA (rs = -0.46), and the lowest for Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (rs = 0.03). A random forest regression model was applied to one city to evaluate the importance of these proxies. Model interpretability analysis indicated that certain psychoactive substances (MDMA, paraxanthine, hydroxybupropion) and the hydrochemical parameter chloride have potential as population markers. However, their applicability is influenced by sociodemographic factors and thus site-specific. Overall, their value lies in providing complementary information for multiparameter models rather than serving as a standalone population marker."

This study assessed whether a 1:1 10 mg/ml THC:CBD combination oil could improve total symptom burden in patients with advanced cancer over that provided by palliative care alone. METHODS: Participants were randomised to medicinal cannabis (MC) or placebo oil; dose escalated over 14 days according to tolerance and efficacy and continued to day 28. Symptoms assessed using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were summated to give a total symptom distress score (TSDS). The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in TSDS at day 14.

The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration rescheduled methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in July 2023 to permit authorised prescribing of MDMA for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) outside of the clinical trial setting. OBJECTIVE: This manuscript describes the development of the Australian Clinical Practice Guideline on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) for PTSD. METHODS: The Guideline will be developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) process. The Guideline will consider the benefits and harms of MDMA-AP compared to other treatments in people with PTSD. High quality systematic reviews identified via an overview of systematic reviews will be used as index and supplementary reviews.

INTRODUCTION: Despite recent clinical and research interest, medical use of psychedelics has not been legalised in most jurisdictions. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration rescheduled methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in July 2023 to permit authorised prescribing of MDMA for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) outside of the clinical trial setting. OBJECTIVE: This manuscript describes the development of the Australian Clinical Practice Guideline on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) for PTSD. METHODS: The Guideline will be developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) process. The Guideline will consider the benefits and harms of MDMA-AP compared to other treatments in people with PTSD. High quality systematic reviews identified via an overview of systematic reviews will be used as index and supplementary reviews. Using the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework, the multidisciplinary Guideline Development Group (GDG) will consider treatment benefits and harms, certainty of evidence, patient preferences and values, resources, equity, acceptability and feasibility. The GDG will be supported by a Stakeholder Group, Expert Group, Conflict of Interest Oversight Committee, and Evidence Review Team.

This Phase I clinical trial is the first to rigorously evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a novel sublingual formulation of 5-MeO-DMT, administered at sub-psychedelic doses to adults with moderate to high levels of anxiety and/or depression, without formal psychiatric diagnosis or ongoing treatment. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, participants received a single weekly sublingual dose of 5-MeO-DMT (6 mg, 9 mg, or 12 mg) or placebo over four weeks. The compound was well tolerated across all groups, with no significant adverse events or signs of organ toxicity; mild side effects such as nausea and headache were transient and self-resolving. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed rapid absorption, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within a median of 20 min and no evidence of drug accumulation.

Methods: A consistent video recording setup was used to capture facial movements of human subjects in response to visual stimuli from a calibrated database. The DISC method utilizes the displacement of naturally occurring skin pores to map the specific locus of underlying muscular movement.

Results: Compared to lithium, esketamine exhibited higher disproportionality for suicidal ideation (ROR = 5.13, 95% CI, 4.48-5.87, P < .0001), while ketamine showed lower disproportionality for suicidal ideation (ROR = 0.76, 95% CI, 0.58-0.99, P = .043), suicide attempt (ROR =0.17, 95% CI, 0.12-0.24, P < .0001), and completed suicide (ROR =0.30, 95% CI, 0.22-0.40, P < .0001). Esketamine also had lower RORs for suicide attempt (ROR = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.39-0.54, P < .0001) and completed suicide (ROR =0.36, 95% CI, 0.30-0.43, P < .0001). When fluoxetine was used as the reference, esketamine showed higher disproportionality for suicidal ideation (ROR = 3.34, 95% CI, 3.06-3.65, P < .0001), while ketamine had a lower ROR (ROR =0.49, 95% CI, 0.39-0.63, P < .0001). For suicidal behavior, esketamine had a lower ROR (ROR =0.37, 95% CI, 0.17-0.81, P = .012), and both ketamine (ROR =0.15, 95% CI, 0.10-0.21, P < .0001) and esketamine (ROR = 0.39, 95% CI, 0.34-0.45, P < .0001) had lower RORs for suicide attempt. Both agents also had lower RORs for completed suicides (ketamine: ROR = 0.24, 95% CI, 0.18-0.32, P < .0001; esketamine: ROR= 0.29, 95% CI, 0.25-0.35, P < .0001). Conclusion: Both increased and decreased RORs for suicidality parameters were observed with ketamine and esketamine, with similar results regardless of whether lithium or fluoxetine was used as the reference.

We conducted a pharmacological challenge study to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of effect of psilocybin in OCD. This analysis reports the clinical outcomes only. METHODS: Participants with a diagnosis of OCD of at least moderate severity, received two single doses of oral psilocybin, 1 mg followed by 10 mg, administered in fixed order separated by 4 weeks. On the day of dosing, they were treated in a day-care facility in the presence of clinicians experienced in the use of psychedelics for treating mental disorders. Psychological support was provided before, during and after dosing. Participants and raters were blinded to the order of treatment. They were assessed on the day before each dose (baseline 1, 2), on the day of dosing and at intervals over a 4-week period afterward using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (primary clinical outcome) and secondary clinical outcomes including the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Adverse effects were also recorded. RESULTS: Nineteen adult participants (aged 20-60) entered the study and 18 completed all assessments. Clinical outcomes following 1 mg and 10 mg psilocybin were compared using a linear mixed-effects model and ANOVA. A significant between-dosage effect favouring 10 mg psilocybin was found one-week after dosing on the Y-BOCS (Cohen's d = 0.82, p = 0.002). In particular, the effect one-week after dosing was statistically significant on the compulsion subscale of the Y-BOCS (Cohen's d: 0.74, p = 0.003), compared to obsession (Cohen's d: 0.50, p = 0.06). The effect diminished over the subsequent 3 weeks. No effect of psilocybin was detected on the MADRS. Psilocybin was well tolerated, with few adverse events reported at both dosages and no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, which was limited by a small sample size and the absence of randomisation, a 10 mg dose of oral psilocybin was found to be well-tolerated and potentially efficacious in patients with OCD. Psilocybin produced a rapid-onset, moderate to large effect on compulsive symptoms, which lasted up to one week after dosing.

Follow-up data indicated 34 % of patients later developed schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and 20.4 % were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. However, the lack of comprehensive follow-up limits the interpretation of findings In conclusion, the evidence supporting treatment options remains limited, primarily based on case reports. Our findings suggest that second-generation antipsychotics seem to be more beneficial in managing psychedelic-induced psychosis, warranting further investigation into optimized treatment protocols."

Here, we present a new automated approach for quantifying HTRs from experimental videos using the open-source machine learning-based toolkits, DeepLabCut (DLC) and Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA). Pose estimation DLC models were trained to predict X,Y coordinates of 13 body parts of C57BL/6J mice using historical experimental videos of HTRs induced by various psychedelic drugs. Next, a non-overlapping set of historical experimental videos was analyzed and used to train SimBA random forest behavioral classifiers to predict the presence of the HTR. The DLC+SimBA approach was then validated using a separate subset of visually scored videos. DLC+SimBA model performance was assessed at different video resolutions (50%, 25%, 12.5%) and frame rates (120, 60, 30 frames per second or fps). Our results indicate that HTRs can be quantified accurately at 50% resolution and 120 fps (precision = 95.45, recall = 95.56, F 1 = 95.51) or at lower frame rates and resolutions (i.e., 50% resolution and 60 fps). The best performing DLC+SimBA model combination was deployed to evaluate the effects of bufotenine, a tryptamine derivative with uncharacterized potency and efficacy in the HTR paradigm. Interestingly, bufotenine only induced elevated HTRs (ED 50 = 0.99 mg/kg, max counts = 24) when serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT 1A ) were pharmacologically blocked and activity at other sites of action may also impact its pharmacological effects (e.g., serotonin transporter). HTR counts for a subset of 21 videos from bufotenine experiments were strongly correlated for DLC+SimBA vs. visual scoring and semi-automated software detection methods ( r = 0.98 and 0.99). Finally, the DLC+SimBA approach displayed high accuracy when compared to visual scoring of HTRs for three serotonergic psychedelic drugs with variable HTR frequencies ( r = 0.99 vs. mean visual scores from 3 blinded raters). In summary, the DLC+SimBA approach represents a modular, noninvasive, and open-source method of HTR detection from experimental videos with accuracy comparable to magnetometer-based approaches and greater speed than visual scoring.","AD.

Next, a non-overlapping set of historical experimental videos was analyzed and used to train SimBA random forest behavioral classifiers to predict the presence of the HTR. The DLC+SimBA approach was then validated using a separate subset of visually scored videos. DLC+SimBA model performance was assessed at different video resolutions (50%, 25%, 12.5%) and frame rates (120, 60, 30 frames per second or fps). Our results indicate that HTRs can be quantified accurately at 50% resolution and 120 fps (precision = 95.45, recall = 95.56, F 1 = 95.51) or at lower frame rates and resolutions (i.e., 50% resolution and 60 fps). The best performing DLC+SimBA model combination was deployed to evaluate the effects of bufotenine, a tryptamine derivative with uncharacterized potency and efficacy in the HTR paradigm. Interestingly, bufotenine only induced elevated HTRs (ED 50 = 0.99 mg/kg, max counts = 24) when serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT 1A ) were pharmacologically blocked and activity at other sites of action may also impact its pharmacological effects (e.g., serotonin transporter). HTR counts for a subset of 21 videos from bufotenine experiments were strongly correlated for DLC+SimBA vs. visual scoring and semi-automated software detection methods ( r = 0.98 and 0.99). Finally, the DLC+SimBA approach displayed high accuracy when compared to visual scoring of HTRs for three serotonergic psychedelic drugs with variable HTR frequencies ( r = 0.99 vs. mean visual scores from 3 blinded raters). In summary, the DLC+SimBA approach represents a modular, noninvasive, and open-source method of HTR detection from experimental videos with accuracy comparable to magnetometer-based approaches and greater speed than visual scoring."

This study aimed to explore such experiences using data from Reddit to better understand their nature and potential therapeutic implications. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, posts and comments on the ""r/LSD"" subreddit reporting gender-themed LSD experiences were analyzed. Posts containing terms related to gender identity, including ""gender,"" ""transgender,"" and ""trans,"" were reviewed and coded using inductive and deductive thematic approaches. RESULTS: Of 94 unique anecdotes, 47.9% of authors identified as non-cisgender at time of LSD use, with most describing experiences that enhanced gender-identity related self-acceptance (80%); 17.0% of authors were gender questioning at the time of LSD use, and most (93.8%) reported clarifying effects of LSD. Fifteen authors (16.0%) reported potential effects of LSD on gender transitioning or plans to transition. A notable minority of the 24 authors identifying as cisgender at time of LSD use (41.7%) explored non-cisgender identities during their LSD experiences, while 29.2% reported their LSD experience introduced a non-cisgender identity for the first time that persisted post-LSD. Challenging experiences were reported by 17.0% of authors, and 11.1% of non-cisgender authors reported LSD experiences that decreased gender identity-related self-acceptance.

METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, posts and comments on the ""r/LSD"" subreddit reporting gender-themed LSD experiences were analyzed. Posts containing terms related to gender identity, including ""gender,"" ""transgender,"" and ""trans,"" were reviewed and coded using inductive and deductive thematic approaches. RESULTS: Of 94 unique anecdotes, 47.9% of authors identified as non-cisgender at time of LSD use, with most describing experiences that enhanced gender-identity related self-acceptance (80%); 17.0% of authors were gender questioning at the time of LSD use, and most (93.8%) reported clarifying effects of LSD. Fifteen authors (16.0%) reported potential effects of LSD on gender transitioning or plans to transition. A notable minority of the 24 authors identifying as cisgender at time of LSD use (41.7%) explored non-cisgender identities during their LSD experiences, while 29.2% reported their LSD experience introduced a non-cisgender identity for the first time that persisted post-LSD. Challenging experiences were reported by 17.0% of authors, and 11.1% of non-cisgender authors reported LSD experiences that decreased gender identity-related self-acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest LSD may support the exploration and acceptance of gender identity in certain individuals, highlighting a potential role in treating gender dysphoria. They also raise important questions about the need for addressing possible LSD-induced gender identity changes during the informed consent process of clinical trials. Given the fragmentary nature of social media data and challenges in analyzing it, these findings should be confirmed with surveys and prospective observational studies."

METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study included 40 healthy participants (20 females, mean age 38). Each received two doses of psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) at least 56 days apart (mean 488) in two neuroimaging study arms. Nearly half had previous psychedelic experience.

Late-stage clinical trials support psychedelics and/or MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as rapidly acting treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD), treatment-resistant depression (TRD), PTSD or generalised anxiety disorders (GAD). Psilocybin, MDMA and LSD were granted FDA breakthrough status for TRD/MDD, PTSD and GAD, respectively, although FDA recently rejected the new drug application of MDMA in PTSD. Most of these drugs target the 5-HT and monoamine systems. Classical psychedelics act as 5-HT2A receptor agonists, although LSD, DMT and psilocybin target other 5-HT and/or dopamine receptors. Psychedelic-dependent 5-HT2A receptor agonism also has profound anti-(neuro)inflammatory effects. Advanced imaging studies suggest that brain 5-HT levels are reduced in depression. Functional magnetic resonance studies show that neural networks (cortico thalamic, salience, default mode) are profoundly impaired in depression. Such network defects are corrected upon psychedelic/entactogen treatment, offering a unique opportunity to serve as biomarkers for depression, anxiety and PTSD precision medicine trials. Psychedelics and entactogens target common end pathways, namely neuroplasticity/synaptogenesis, either directly via monoamine or glutamate receptors and/or indirectly, via BDNF and mTORC1 pathways. Together, these findings strongly support a biological basis for MDD, GAD, PTSD and related conditions, which can be considered as mixed biochemical, neurological and neuroimmune disorders, and are profoundly modified by psychedelics, entactogens and the newly developed psychoplastogens.",D.

Currently, the most actively investigated rapidly acting antidepressants, anxiolytics and/or anti PTSD agents, include psychedelics e.g. psilocybin, LSD, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, ayahuasca; non-hallucinogenic entactogens, e.g. MDMA; psychoplastogens which rapidly promote neuroplasticity, e.g. ibogaine, ketamine and esketamine; and other atypicals e.g. dextromorphan/bupropion, esmethadone. Late-stage clinical trials support psychedelics and/or MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as rapidly acting treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD), treatment-resistant depression (TRD), PTSD or generalised anxiety disorders (GAD). Psilocybin, MDMA and LSD were granted FDA breakthrough status for TRD/MDD, PTSD and GAD, respectively, although FDA recently rejected the new drug application of MDMA in PTSD. Most of these drugs target the 5-HT and monoamine systems. Classical psychedelics act as 5-HT2A receptor agonists, although LSD, DMT and psilocybin target other 5-HT and/or dopamine receptors. Psychedelic-dependent 5-HT2A receptor agonism also has profound anti-(neuro)inflammatory effects. Advanced imaging studies suggest that brain 5-HT levels are reduced in depression. Functional magnetic resonance studies show that neural networks (cortico thalamic, salience, default mode) are profoundly impaired in depression. Such network defects are corrected upon psychedelic/entactogen treatment, offering a unique opportunity to serve as biomarkers for depression, anxiety and PTSD precision medicine trials. Psychedelics and entactogens target common end pathways, namely neuroplasticity/synaptogenesis, either directly via monoamine or glutamate receptors and/or indirectly, via BDNF and mTORC1 pathways. Together, these findings strongly support a biological basis for MDD, GAD, PTSD and related conditions, which can be considered as mixed biochemical, neurological and neuroimmune disorders, and are profoundly modified by psychedelics, entactogens and the newly developed psychoplastogens."

To further assess this potential benefit, a meta-analysis was conducted. METHODS: Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed were searched from inception through March 2025. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences along with their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was the incidence of PPD risk as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Secondary outcomes were EPDS score, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) postoperative pain score, and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 2716 patients were analyzed. Esketamine used perioperatively lowers the risk of PPD and EPDS scores at 1 and 6 weeks after cesarean section and reduces NRS pain scores within 48 h during movement and 24 h at rest. However, it also increases adverse effects like hallucinations, dizziness, blurred vision, and diplopia. Additionally, prenatal body mass index (BMI) is inversely correlated with mood response to esketamine one week after surgery. LIMITATIONS: There was clinical heterogeneity, diagnostic interview for PPD with different EPDS score, and sample was not racially diverse among studies. CONCLUSION: Current research suggests that esketamine may reduce the incidence of PPD risk, EPDS score, and NRS pain score after cesarean section with short-term complications.

COVID-19 vaccination provides robust immunity against SARS-CoV-2, but immunocompromised populations may have weaker immune responses. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 spike (trimer) total IgG/IgM/IgA (total Ig) to investigate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in people living with HIV (PLWH), considering CD4+ T cell count, viral load, substance use, and comorbidities. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Miami, Florida, between May 2021 and December 2021 as part of the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics-Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) initiative (3U01DA040381-05S1) and the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort (U01DA040381). Blood samples were collected and SARS-CoV-2 spike (trimer) total Ig was quantified. HIV serostatus, viral load, CD4+ T cell count, and COVID-19 vaccinations were abstracted from medical records. Substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and drug use [marijuana, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamine, amphetamine, hallucinogens, ecstasy, or misuse of prescription drugs]), and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune disease, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and substance use disorders) were assessed via validated questionnaires. Drug use was confirmed via urine toxicology. Multivariable linear regression was conducted. Results: Median age (n = 1317) was 57.8 years, 49.8% were male, 50% were Black non-Hispanic, 66.2% had received ≥1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 29.6% were PLWH (71.3% virally suppressed and median CD4+ T cell count > 500 cells/µL). PLWH, compared to people without HIV, were more likely to have received ≥1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (76.2% vs. 62.0%, p < 0.001) and present with substance use (77.2% vs. 42.9%, p < 0.001) and comorbidities (72.8% vs. 48.2%, p < 0.001). Vaccinated PLWH, compared to unvaccinated PLWH, had higher CD4+ T cell counts (577.5 vs. 517.5, p = 0.011) and were more likely to be virally suppressed (76.4% vs. 54.8%, p < 0.001). A lower CD4+ T cell count (<200 vs. ≥500, β = -0.400, p = 0.033) and higher HIV viral load (≥200-<5000 vs. <200, β = -0.275, p < 0.001) were associated with lower spike (trimer) total Ig titers, indicating a diminished response to COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: A lower CD4+ T cell count and higher HIV viremia were linked to reduced SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity in racial/ethnic minority PLWH, a population underrepresented in vaccine clinical trials.

Vaccinated PLWH, compared to unvaccinated PLWH, had higher CD4+ T cell counts (577.5 vs. 517.5, p = 0.011) and were more likely to be virally suppressed (76.4% vs. 54.8%, p < 0.001). A lower CD4+ T cell count (<200 vs. ≥500, β = -0.400, p = 0.033) and higher HIV viral load (≥200-<5000 vs. <200, β = -0.275, p < 0.001) were associated with lower spike (trimer) total Ig titers, indicating a diminished response to COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: A lower CD4+ T cell count and higher HIV viremia were linked to reduced SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity in racial/ethnic minority PLWH, a population underrepresented in vaccine clinical trials. HIV care providers should target efforts to maintain viral suppression to avoid diminished responses to COVID-19 vaccination."

Their long onset of action, interactions, and side effects are obstacles to achieving lasting remission of this prevalent, often chronic or recurrent, pathology. Faced with this clinical necessity, research efforts have intensified in recent years around psychedelic drugs, with a particular focus on the mental health benefits of psilocybin. To illustrate this promising approach, we present here the clinical vignette of a student living in France for whom psilocybin led to complete remission after recurrent depressive episodes and a two-year course of Escitalopram. CASE PRESENTATION: Juan, a Mexican student, decided to move to France in 2015 to further his education and broaden his horizons. Since his degree in physiotherapy from Mexico did not qualify him to practice in France, he began studying Biology from 2016 to 2020. Unfortunately, during this period, Juan experienced his first episode of major unipolar depression, marked by feelings of incompetence and academic stagnation. In March 2017, he started an initial course of Escitalopram at 5mg, which provided some relief from his depressive symptoms but did not completely alleviate his anxiety and ruminative thoughts. The treatment was discontinued after three months due to a summer travel plan. By January 2018, he encountered a more intense depressive episode for which he resumed Escitalopram at an increased dose of 10mg. He continued this treatment until August 2019, although it again proved insufficient for full symptom relief. In January 2020, he faced his most challenging relapse, sometimes unable to get out of bed for weeks. This led him to resume Escitalopram, this time at 15mg, but he struggled with significant side effects, including nausea, fatigue, and numbness. Seeking alternative solutions, in the summer of 2020 Juan tried a non-conventional approach in Mexico using psilocybin, a compound found in hallucinogenic mushrooms, under the supervision of a shaman. Following the first administration in July, he noticed a rapid partial improvement in his symptoms; a second administration two weeks later resulted in a full remission of his depressive symptoms. Juan described his experience as profoundly healing, gaining an inner peace and a deep understanding of his struggles. Since 2020, he has remained in full remission without the need for antidepressants. This case highlights the potential role of psilocybin in addressing treatment-resistant depression and the importance of further research into alternative therapeutic options. DISCUSSION: Psilocybin, a 5-HT2A serotonergic receptor agonist, affects cortical neural networks by reducing amygdala reactivity to negative emotions and altering brain connectivity. According to David Nutt's drug harm scale, psilocybin ranks among the least dangerous substances with a relatively low potential for dependence. Despite its potential benefits, responsible and supervised use is essential. Under carefully prepared conditions, psilocybin's psychedelic effects can promote healing by facilitating introspection and altering depressive brain functioning. In April 2021, a double-blind, randomized trial by a British team at Imperial College London compared psilocybin to Escitalopram, revealing higher response and remission rates for psilocybin : 70% of psilocybin-treated patients experienced a reduction of over 50 % in depression levels, compared to 48 % of those on antidepressants-a 22 % increase. However, with only 59 subjects and a 6-week Escitalopram treatment for the control group, further research with larger samples and extended treatment durations is essential. CONCLUSION: The psychedelic experience appears to have significantly accelerated Juan's clinical remission, enabling him to regain control over his life after years of depression. Although multiple factors may have contributed to Juan's recovery-including his course of Escitalopram-psychedelic effects seem to have served as a powerful tool in overcoming his depression.

Preclinical and clinical evidence.,"Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) presents substantial clinical challenges, particularly in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and older adults experiencing late-life depression. Traditional monoaminergic therapies often fail in this population due to neurodegenerative changes that impact receptor dynamics and neurotransmitter systems. Emerging evidence suggests that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, esketamine, and arketamine, may offer new avenues for treatment. This review examines the potential of ketamine and its derivatives in treating TRD in older adults and individuals with AD, focusing on their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and limitations in the context of neurodegenerative pathology. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases up until January 2025, with no year restrictions. Nineteen human clinical studies and eight preclinical studies met the inclusion criteria. Evidence suggests that ketamine may offer advantages over standard treatments for AD, potentially due to its broader mechanism of action compared to the NMDA antagonist memantine, as observed in animal models of AD. Clinical findings have demonstrated the rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine and esketamine, alleviating depressive symptoms in both AD patients and older adults with TRD, indicating their potential as effective therapeutic options for these complex conditions.","A.

Traditional monoaminergic therapies often fail in this population due to neurodegenerative changes that impact receptor dynamics and neurotransmitter systems. Emerging evidence suggests that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, esketamine, and arketamine, may offer new avenues for treatment. This review examines the potential of ketamine and its derivatives in treating TRD in older adults and individuals with AD, focusing on their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and limitations in the context of neurodegenerative pathology. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases up until January 2025, with no year restrictions. Nineteen human clinical studies and eight preclinical studies met the inclusion criteria. Evidence suggests that ketamine may offer advantages over standard treatments for AD, potentially due to its broader mechanism of action compared to the NMDA antagonist memantine, as observed in animal models of AD. Clinical findings have demonstrated the rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine and esketamine, alleviating depressive symptoms in both AD patients and older adults with TRD, indicating their potential as effective therapeutic options for these complex conditions."

Due to its rapid antidepressant and anti-suicidal properties, it is used as a treatment for major depressive disorder. Furthermore, ketamine evokes dissociative and psychotropic states, which allows the modeling of schizophrenic symptoms. The thalamus, a main target for ketamine's actions, consists of different nuclei responsible for sensory gating, attention, and consciousness. Thus, we here examine the effects of intranasally applied ketamine on thalamic structures in healthy individuals in a cross-over placebo-controlled study. METHODS: Twenty-six subjects (14 female, mean age ± SD = 24.3 ± 3 years) underwent two magnetic resonance imaging scans on a 3T system immediately after receiving a subanesthetic dose of 56 mg esketamine (2x Spravato 28mg nasal sprays) or placebo in a cross-over study design. FreeSurfer was used for morphological analysis of the thalamus and its distinct nuclei based on derived T1-weighted MPRAGE images. Repeated measure analyses of covariance across the whole group, regardless of measurement order, and the subgroup, receiving placebo in the first scan, were performed for the thalamus and all its nuclei, for each hemisphere, separately. Post hoc tests on thalamic nuclei were done in an exploratory manner. RESULTS: We found a significant volume increase in the right thalamus (pcorr. = .048), the pulvinar anterior nucleus (p = .048), and the right mediodorsal lateral parvocellular (p = .034) after esketamine in the subsample receiving placebo application in the first scan. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest rapid structural adaptations in right thalamic structures which serve as relay stations for the visual cortex.

RESULTS: Among 268 participants, 48.5 % had a diagnosed mental illness, 45.1 % were at risk of suicide, 61.2 % reported psychotic symptoms, 45.1 % had high-risk methamphetamine use, and 82.1 % had taken substances other than methamphetamine and psychedelics. Most psychedelic experiences were unplanned (52.6 %), recreationally motivated (73 %), and combined with other drugs (52.6 %). Post-experience, participants reported improved mood (59.3 %) and social functioning (49.6 %), and reduced use of methamphetamine (34.0 %) and other substances (35.1 %). Forward planning and less challenging experiences were linked to improved mood (aOR 1.84, p = 0.048; aOR 2.21, p = 0.012) and reduced substance use (aOR 2.27, p = 0.008; aOR 3.58, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Psychedelic use among people who use methamphetamine may improve mood and social function, and reduce substance use. The complex findings highlight the potential importance of psychosocial and environmental factors (""set and setting"") in determining outcomes, underscoring the need for controlled clinical trials and tailored harm reduction strategies."

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of data from an open-label multi-center, clinical trial (BioK) examining biomarkers of treatment response, that enrolled 75 patients (ages 18-65 years old) with treatment-resistant unipolar or bipolar depression, excluding those with an active substance use disorder, psychosis, and unstable medical conditions. Pre-existing treatments were continued. Participants received 3 IV ketamine infusions over an 11-day period (acute phase). Depressive symptoms were measured using MADRS, with the four phenotypes assigned as positive or negative based on the total subset MADRS score. Change in depressive symptoms and odds of remissions (MADRS<10 after infusion #3) were analyzed for all 4 phenotypes. RESULTS: 53 % of all participants achieved remission by the end of the acute phase. All MADRS phenotypes had significant decreases from baseline in their respective mean factor scores. Negative Thoughts was the least improved after infusion #3. Higher baseline scores for Sadness were associated with lower rates of remission. Neurovegetative was the least responsive to treatment.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed esketamine-based anesthesia induction for category-1 emergency CS at our hospital between November 2022 and November 2024. Modified rapid sequence induction included 0.5 mg/kg esketamine, 1 mg/kg propofol, and 1 mg/kg rocuronium, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained by propofol infusion at 4 mg/kg/h and inhalation of 1.5% sevoflurane. The dose of propofol and sevoflurane was adjusted to maintain the BIS value at 40-60. RESULTS: The final cohort comprised 11 patients. The median 1-minute Apgar score was 9 points [range, 6-10], and the 5-minute Apgar score was 10 points for all newborns. The mean decision-to-delivery interval (DDI) was 10.9 ± 2.4 min. Only one newborn required temporary mask ventilation due to acute fetal distress, mainly caused by major placental abruption.

METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, eighty female patients with thyroid cancer were scheduled to undergo surgery under general anesthesia. The patients were randomly divided into an esketamine group (group E) and a control group (group C), with 40 patients in each group. During the induction period of general anesthesia, group E received an intravenous injection of esketamine (0.5 mg/kg), while group C received an intravenous injection of 0.9% sodium chloride.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effects of an ayahuasca-inspired novel DMT/HAR (N,N-dimethyltryptamine/Harmine) formulation and Harmine alone on face recognition and self-referential processing, as measured by event-related potentials (ERPs) and subjective behavioral measures. METHODS: In a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 30 healthy male participants underwent EEG recording during a visual oddball task involving Self, Familiar, and Unknown Faces. The study compared the effects of a DMT/HAR formulation, Harmine alone, and Placebo on key visual ERP components: P1, N170, and P300. RESULTS: DMT/HAR increased the P1 and decreased the N170 amplitudes across all face categories, indicating enhanced early visual responsiveness and disrupted face structural encoding. Crucially, DMT/HAR reduced the neural differentiation between self and other faces occurring within the P300 wave compared to Harmine alone, and Placebo. Familiar face processing remained stable across conditions, suggesting that socially meaningful representations were preserved despite psychedelic-induced perceptions shifts. CONCLUSION: While broadly disrupting early visual processing across face categories, the DMT/HAR formulation selectively attenuated the neural distinction between self and other faces, revealing a potential neural correlate of diminished self-referential processing. This effect underscores the serotonergic modulation of face recognition and suggests a reorganization of self-related neural dynamics under psychedelics. By reducing self-other differentiation, psychedelics may promote cognitive and emotional flexibility. These mechanisms could support therapeutic effects in conditions marked by rigid self-focus, such as depression and social anxiety, offering new perspectives on their clinical application.","D.

The study compared the effects of a DMT/HAR formulation, Harmine alone, and Placebo on key visual ERP components: P1, N170, and P300. RESULTS: DMT/HAR increased the P1 and decreased the N170 amplitudes across all face categories, indicating enhanced early visual responsiveness and disrupted face structural encoding. Crucially, DMT/HAR reduced the neural differentiation between self and other faces occurring within the P300 wave compared to Harmine alone, and Placebo. Familiar face processing remained stable across conditions, suggesting that socially meaningful representations were preserved despite psychedelic-induced perceptions shifts. CONCLUSION: While broadly disrupting early visual processing across face categories, the DMT/HAR formulation selectively attenuated the neural distinction between self and other faces, revealing a potential neural correlate of diminished self-referential processing. This effect underscores the serotonergic modulation of face recognition and suggests a reorganization of self-related neural dynamics under psychedelics. By reducing self-other differentiation, psychedelics may promote cognitive and emotional flexibility. These mechanisms could support therapeutic effects in conditions marked by rigid self-focus, such as depression and social anxiety, offering new perspectives on their clinical application."

Little is known about how common comorbidities in the veteran population, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), may influence ketamine and esketamine treatment outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed clinical outcomes from Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System's ketamine program to assess the relationship between ketamine or esketamine treatment and changes in depression and PTSD symptoms, while also examining how common medical comorbidities influence treatment outcomes. We specifically examined whether a patient's history of TBI or OSA would affect ketamine or esketamine treatment outcomes. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine how TBI and OSA history interacted with ketamine/esketamine treatment to change PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. RESULTS: This study included 119 veterans who received eight sessions of ketamine or esketamine treatment at the San Diego VA Medical Center. Using linear effects modeling, we found that repeated ketamine or esketamine sessions were significantly correlated with reductions in both depression (p < 0.005) and PTSD (p < 0.05) symptom scores. However, in veterans with comorbid TBI (n = 38) and severe OSA (n = 9), depression symptoms did not improve over the course of ketamine or esketamine treatment, suggesting this subgroup may require alternative treatments or OSA treatment prior to starting ketamine or esketamine treatment.

BACKGROUND: Ketamine and esketamine are increasingly used to manage treatment-resistant depression and have also been shown to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Little is known about how common comorbidities in the veteran population, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), may influence ketamine and esketamine treatment outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed clinical outcomes from Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System's ketamine program to assess the relationship between ketamine or esketamine treatment and changes in depression and PTSD symptoms, while also examining how common medical comorbidities influence treatment outcomes. We specifically examined whether a patient's history of TBI or OSA would affect ketamine or esketamine treatment outcomes. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine how TBI and OSA history interacted with ketamine/esketamine treatment to change PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. RESULTS: This study included 119 veterans who received eight sessions of ketamine or esketamine treatment at the San Diego VA Medical Center. Using linear effects modeling, we found that repeated ketamine or esketamine sessions were significantly correlated with reductions in both depression (p < 0.005) and PTSD (p < 0.05) symptom scores. However, in veterans with comorbid TBI (n = 38) and severe OSA (n = 9), depression symptoms did not improve over the course of ketamine or esketamine treatment, suggesting this subgroup may require alternative treatments or OSA treatment prior to starting ketamine or esketamine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine and esketamine treatment did not improve symptoms of depression in veterans with comorbid TBI and severe OSA. Thus, our findings generally support ketamine and esketamine as effective interventions for depression and PTSD, while emphasizing the consideration of comorbidities such as OSA and TBI."

The second outcomes were the severity changes of depression and anxiety. The cognitive function, the nicotine dependence, urge to smoke, respiratory symptoms and adverse events were also examined. We found that 8 sessions of ESK treatments significantly improved the self-reported (44.1 %) and biologically verified (28.8 %) continuous abstinence rates. Additionally, the severity of both depression and anxiety was also significantly relieved by ESK delivery. Furthermore, ESK was capable of improving cognitive function of the participants. Finally, the nicotine dependence, urge to smoke and smoking related respiratory symptoms of ESK group were also alleviated at the completion of follow-up. No serious adverse events were observed throughout the study. This clinical trial provides evidence that ESK treatment is efficacious and safe for quitting cigarette smoking among patients with lung cancer and MDD."

Consumers are often unaware that Tusi contains a mixture of ketamine and other drugs, and the concoction can be confused with 2C/2C-B (ring-substituted phenethylamines/4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine) or cocaine. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and correlates of past-year Tusi use in the electronic dance music (EDM) nightclub-attending population in New York City (NYC), US. DESIGN AND SETTING: This cross-sectional study included surveys and optional saliva testing of adults entering randomly selected EDM events in NYC in 2024. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥18 years entering EDM events at nightclubs (n = 1465). MEASUREMENTS: Exposures were demographic characteristics and past-year use of other drugs. The primary outcome was self-reported past-year use of Tusi, and in a subsample, biologically confirmed exposure to various drugs determined by saliva testing. FINDINGS: Based on self-report, an estimated 2.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-3.9] of adults in the NYC EDM nightclub-attending population have used Tusi in the past year. Compared with white individuals, Hispanic individuals were at higher odds for use [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5.10, 95% CI = 1.96-13.25]. Compared with those who did not use, those who used ecstasy/3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (aOR = 6.59, 95% CI = 1.60-27.16), ketamine (aOR = 3.44, 95% CI = 1.18-10.08) and/or 2C series (aOR = 14.82, 95% CI = 4.77-46.04) in the past year were at higher odds for use. Compared with those not reporting Tusi use, those reporting past-year use were more likely to have saliva test positive for cocaine, ketamine, MDMA, methamphetamine and/or synthetic cathinones (Ps < 0.001). They were also more likely to test positive for cocaine, ketamine or methamphetamine after not reporting past-year use (Ps < 0.01).

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: 'Tusi', also known as 'tusibí' or 'pink cocaine', is a drug concoction which previously emerged in Latin America and Europe and has recently acquired popularity in the United States (US). Consumers are often unaware that Tusi contains a mixture of ketamine and other drugs, and the concoction can be confused with 2C/2C-B (ring-substituted phenethylamines/4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine) or cocaine. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and correlates of past-year Tusi use in the electronic dance music (EDM) nightclub-attending population in New York City (NYC), US. DESIGN AND SETTING: This cross-sectional study included surveys and optional saliva testing of adults entering randomly selected EDM events in NYC in 2024. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥18 years entering EDM events at nightclubs (n = 1465). MEASUREMENTS: Exposures were demographic characteristics and past-year use of other drugs. The primary outcome was self-reported past-year use of Tusi, and in a subsample, biologically confirmed exposure to various drugs determined by saliva testing. FINDINGS: Based on self-report, an estimated 2.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-3.9] of adults in the NYC EDM nightclub-attending population have used Tusi in the past year. Compared with white individuals, Hispanic individuals were at higher odds for use [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5.10, 95% CI = 1.96-13.25]. Compared with those who did not use, those who used ecstasy/3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (aOR = 6.59, 95% CI = 1.60-27.16), ketamine (aOR = 3.44, 95% CI = 1.18-10.08) and/or 2C series (aOR = 14.82, 95% CI = 4.77-46.04) in the past year were at higher odds for use. Compared with those not reporting Tusi use, those reporting past-year use were more likely to have saliva test positive for cocaine, ketamine, MDMA, methamphetamine and/or synthetic cathinones (Ps < 0.001). They were also more likely to test positive for cocaine, ketamine or methamphetamine after not reporting past-year use (Ps < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: An estimated 2.7% of electronic dance music-nightclub attending adults in New York City appear to have used Tusi in the past year, with higher use among Hispanic individuals and people exposed (sometimes unintentionally) to other drugs."

Miscarriage, as an adverse pregnancy outcome, and following curettage for treatment, add the risks of further psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, etc., and current approaches to prevention are unsatisfactory. Ketamine and its S-enantiomer esketamine can prevent postpartum depression, and esketamine even treats depressive symptoms after miscarriage curettage, but their side effects bring limitations. Ascorbic acid (AA, Vitamin C) can modulate mood and enhance ketamine's antidepressant efficacy synergistically, reducing its dosages and adverse effects potentially. The purpose of this study is to clarify the beneficial modification of AA on esketamine for preventing depression and other mental disorders in patients with miscarriage after painless curettage, as well as the interaction between AA and esketamine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a 2×2 factorial, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial that will recruit women with miscarriage undergoing painless curettage. A total of 424 participants will be recruited and randomly 1:1:1:1 allocated to the following four groups (106 in each): Group A0K0 (normal saline and normal saline), Group A0K1 (normal saline and esketamine), Group A1K0 (AA and normal saline), and Group A1K1 (AA and esketamine). The primary outcome is the incidence of depression on postoperative day 7, assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The secondary outcomes include the EPDS score, assessments of anxiety, sleep, and pain, adverse events, perianesthetic data and patient satisfaction. DISCUSSION: This study provides the clinical trial-based evidence of the effects of AA alone or in combination/interacting with the emerging rapid-acting antidepressant esketamine on depression and other mental disorders in patients with miscarriage undergoing painless curettage. Our data are expected to suggest AA's potential application for optimizing strategies of promoting post-miscarriage mental health, and its possible adjunctive improvement of (es)ketamine's usage as antidepressants.

A total of 424 participants will be recruited and randomly 1:1:1:1 allocated to the following four groups (106 in each): Group A0K0 (normal saline and normal saline), Group A0K1 (normal saline and esketamine), Group A1K0 (AA and normal saline), and Group A1K1 (AA and esketamine). The primary outcome is the incidence of depression on postoperative day 7, assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The secondary outcomes include the EPDS score, assessments of anxiety, sleep, and pain, adverse events, perianesthetic data and patient satisfaction. DISCUSSION: This study provides the clinical trial-based evidence of the effects of AA alone or in combination/interacting with the emerging rapid-acting antidepressant esketamine on depression and other mental disorders in patients with miscarriage undergoing painless curettage. Our data are expected to suggest AA's potential application for optimizing strategies of promoting post-miscarriage mental health, and its possible adjunctive improvement of (es)ketamine's usage as antidepressants. One major limitation is that this study is a single-center study, and the results might be biased due to regional factors."

CONCLUSION: These results validate NP-I as a biomarker for endogenous OXT secretion after stimulation with MDMA, addressing long-standing challenges in direct OXT measurement. NP-I offers novel opportunities for research in conditions where reduced OXT levels or disruptions in signaling are implicated, such as autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and depression."

Traditional analgesics often have limitations and side effects, prompting the need for alternative solutions. This study evaluates the impact of an esketamine intravenous analgesic pump on postoperative pain and psychological status in postpartum women following cesarean section. METHODS: A comprehensive retrospective evaluation was conducted at our institution from October 2021 to July 2023, including 168 patients who underwent cesarean delivery. The observation group (n = 82) received esketamine via an intravenous analgesic pump, while the control group (n = 86) received traditional analgesic therapy. Data collected included demographic information, surgical details, postoperative pain (assessed using the Visual Analog Scale, VAS), psychological status (assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS), recovery metrics, and adverse reactions. RESULTS: The observation group demonstrated consistently lower VAS scores at all postoperative time points compared to the control group, indicating superior pain control. EPDS scores were significantly lower in the observation group at 3, 5, and 14 days postoperatively, suggesting better psychological outcomes. The incidence of postpartum depression was also lower in the observation group at 3, 5, and 14 days.

It is best evidenced in treatment resistant depression and in palliative care, where patients are usually treated in specialist care centers. It has a novel mechanism of action, targeting the 5HT2A receptor, and can show rapid onset of action. There are many questions regarding its use that remain to be clarified, including its efficacy for other indications and its role as adjunctive treatment in psychotherapy. The psychoactive, or psychedelic effects are well documented, but their clinical importance is disputed."

The glutamatergic modulator ketamine exerts rapid antidepressant effects, prompting investigators to assess its impact on cognitive function, specifically working memory. This study explored ketamine's influence on working memory and magnetoencephalography (MEG) patterns during a working memory task in individuals with TRD. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of ketamine on working memory, attention, and concentration, and to study MEG patterns during a working memory task in individuals with TRD. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals with TRD (14 with bipolar disorder, 7 with major depressive disorder) received ketamine and placebo infusions in a crossover trial. Behavioral and MEG data were collected at baseline and 6 to 9 h after ketamine and placebo (normal saline) infusion. Working memory, attention, and concentration were assessed with the N-back task. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly improved depressive symptoms but had no effect on cognitive performance. MEG revealed increased gamma power in the parieto-occipital junction coupled with decreased gamma power in the posterior superior temporal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus after ketamine administration compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Despite robust antidepressant effects, ketamine did not affect working memory, attention, or concentration. However, distinct gamma power changes in brain regions linked to attention and working memory highlight the need to further explore the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ketamine's cognitive effects in TRD. Future research with larger samples, broader cognitive batteries, and repeated ketamine infusions are needed to fully elucidate ketamine's cognitive effects in individuals with TRD.","A. Fijtman, M.

METHOD: Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) data derived from two previous clinical trials of a single, low-dose ketamine infusion were analysed. In clinical trial 1 (Trial 1), patients with TRD were randomised to either a ketamine or normal saline group, while in clinical trial 2 (Trial 2) those patients with TRD and pronounced suicidal symptoms received a single infusion of either 0.05 mg/kg ketamine or 0.045 mg/kg midazolam.

PATIENTS: 108 women 18-65 years old who were scheduled for elective breast cancer surgery. All had preoperative depressive symptoms as defined by Montgomery-Åsberg depression scores ≥12 (range, 0-60; higher scores indicate more severe depression). INTERVENTIONS: Eligible participants were randomized to esketamine 0.25 mg/kg or saline placebo. Blinded trial drugs were given intravenously over the initial 40 min of anesthesia.

People also use amphetamines recreationally or in an attempt to boost cognitive or athletic performance. Amphetamines have the potential to increase blood pressure, and we do not know if the long-term benefits of daily amphetamine use outweigh the potential harms. OBJECTIVES: Primary: to quantify the changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in children and adults taking amphetamines, compared to placebo. Secondary: to quantify the changes in heart rate in children and adults taking amphetamines, compared to placebo; to quantify the number of withdrawals due to adverse effects of amphetamine, compared to placebo. SEARCH METHODS: We used the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trial registers, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify the studies included in the review. We imposed no restrictions on language, publication year or publication status. The latest search date was March 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of daily oral amphetamines versus placebo on blood pressure. There were no restrictions on participants' age or gender. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) above atmospheric pressure; continuous outcomes). Secondary outcomes were heart rate (measured as beats per minute; continuous outcome) and withdrawals due to adverse effects (dichotomous outcome). We calculated continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We expressed withdrawals due to adverse effects as a risk ratio with 95% CI. We used a fixed-effect model to pool effect sizes from all studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 56 RCTs with a total of 10,583 participants, both adults and children. Most studies were conducted in North America (mainly the USA), followed by Europe. A few studies took place in Asia (Japan) and Australia. The studies tested racemic amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, mixed amphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine (MDMA) and methylphenidate. The amphetamines were prescribed for ADHD, weight loss and other indications. In 48 RCTs, blood pressure was measured within 24 hours of the last dose. Based on data from all included studies, amphetamines increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 1.93 mmHg (95% CI 1.54 to 2.31) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 1.84 mmHg (95% CI 1.51 to 2.16) (56 studies, 10,583 participants; high-certainty evidence for both). Amphetamines increased heart rate by 3.71 beats per minute (95% CI 3.27 to 4.14; 47 studies, 10,075 participants; high-certainty evidence). In a subgroup analysis limited to studies that gave participants amphetamines for at least eight weeks, the effects were similar, suggesting that these are sustained effects. These findings suggest that people taking daily oral amphetamines are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Participants in the amphetamine group were also more likely to withdraw from the study due to adverse effects compared to those given placebo (risk ratio 2.69, 95% CI 2.13 to 3.40; absolute risk increase of 4.3% over an average duration of 1 month; 42 studies, 8952 participants; high-certainty evidence). In general, the studies were well-executed, and the methodology was sound. We judged most studies to have a low risk of bias across most domains. Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment) was the domain most often rated as at unclear risk of bias, because the methods used were not reported. We judged 13 studies (23%) to have a high risk of bias in at least one of the seven domains, primarily due to high dropout rates, leading to a high risk of attrition bias.

OBJECTIVES: This paper explored reasons why healthy people register for psychedelic trials, factors that they considered to contribute to either positive or negative study experiences, and under which circumstances they would seek a psychedelic experience again. METHODS: This study used the data of 151 healthy volunteers who had ingested serotonergic psychedelics in one of six randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials at the same research site under similar conditions. The data were analyzed through qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The predominant motivations to participate in a trial were interest in psychedelics and an appealing setting. Expectations involved personal development and the occurrence of typical psychedelic effects. Hopes included transformative processes. The setting factors that promoted a positive experience were music and access to nature, whereas the sterile hospital environment was considered bothersome. Most participants valued the trusting relationship with their investigator. The most commonly criticized investigator characteristics were a perceived lack of support and investigator-induced psychological discomfort. Most participants considered their expectations exceeded and would take the study substances again, preferably in a setting in nature with friends. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identified four pivotal factors to be considered for psychedelic study experiences: (1) a secure interpersonal relationship, (2) an aesthetically pleasing environment, (3) access to nature, and (4) the use of music.

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esketamine for the prophylaxis of POND. METHODS: Electronic databases were comprehensively searched from inception to April 1, 2024, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the impact of perioperative esketamine on POND in adult patients. The primary outcomes were the incidence of POND and the level of postoperative cognitive function. The secondary outcomes included recovery characteristics (i.e., respiratory depression, extubation time, agitation, hallucinations, and nightmares) and inflammatory markers. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate the heterogeneity and effect of esketamine dosage. RESULTS: A total of 24 RCTs (n = 2,130 patients), all conducted in China with relatively short follow-up periods (≤ 3 months), were included. Esketamine was found to significantly reduce the risk of POND (risk ratio:0.53, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-0.67) and improved cognitive function on postoperative day 1 (standardized mean difference [SMD]:1.22, 95%CI:0.85-1.59) and day 3 (SMD:0.94, 95%CI: 0.46-1.43) compared with controls, without impacting recovery characteristics. Furthermore, esketamine was associated with lower pain scores, reduced risk of postoperative nausea/vomiting, and decreased levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, and S100β). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that age, quality of studies, type of esketamine administration, and esketamine dosage did not have a significant impact on cognitive outcomes.

However, LSD's efficacy in reducing ADHD symptoms remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of repeated low doses of LSD in reducing ADHD symptoms compared with placebo. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2A randomized clinical trial conducted between December 17, 2021, and December 4, 2023. Data were analyzed from March 22, 2024, to August 19, 2024. Outpatient treatment was provided at 2 centers: University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland, and Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Adults aged 18 to 65 years with a prior ADHD diagnosis who presented with moderate to severe symptoms (Adult Investigator Symptom Rating Scale [AISRS] score ≥26 and Clinical Global Impression Severity score ≥4) were eligible for inclusion. Key exclusion criteria included selected current major psychiatric or somatic disorders and the use of potentially interacting medications. INTERVENTION: Participants received either LSD (20 μg) or placebo twice weekly for 6 weeks (total of 12 doses). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in ADHD symptoms from baseline to week 6, assessed by the AISRS and analyzed with a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. RESULTS: A total of 53 participants were randomized to LSD (n = 27) or placebo (n = 26). Mean (SD) participant age was 37 (12) years, and 22 participants (42%) were female. The LSD group presented a mean AISRS improvement of -7.1 points (95% CI, -10.1 to -4.0). The placebo group presented a mean AISRS improvement of -8.9 points (95% CI, -12.0 to -5.8), with no difference between groups. LSD was physically safe and psychologically well tolerated overall. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, repeated low-dose LSD administration was safe in an outpatient setting, but it was not more efficacious than placebo in reducing ADHD symptoms.

IMPORTANCE: Microdosing psychedelics, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), has gained attention for its potential benefits in several psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, LSD's efficacy in reducing ADHD symptoms remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of repeated low doses of LSD in reducing ADHD symptoms compared with placebo. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2A randomized clinical trial conducted between December 17, 2021, and December 4, 2023. Data were analyzed from March 22, 2024, to August 19, 2024. Outpatient treatment was provided at 2 centers: University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland, and Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Adults aged 18 to 65 years with a prior ADHD diagnosis who presented with moderate to severe symptoms (Adult Investigator Symptom Rating Scale [AISRS] score ≥26 and Clinical Global Impression Severity score ≥4) were eligible for inclusion. Key exclusion criteria included selected current major psychiatric or somatic disorders and the use of potentially interacting medications. INTERVENTION: Participants received either LSD (20 μg) or placebo twice weekly for 6 weeks (total of 12 doses). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in ADHD symptoms from baseline to week 6, assessed by the AISRS and analyzed with a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. RESULTS: A total of 53 participants were randomized to LSD (n = 27) or placebo (n = 26). Mean (SD) participant age was 37 (12) years, and 22 participants (42%) were female. The LSD group presented a mean AISRS improvement of -7.1 points (95% CI, -10.1 to -4.0). The placebo group presented a mean AISRS improvement of -8.9 points (95% CI, -12.0 to -5.8), with no difference between groups. LSD was physically safe and psychologically well tolerated overall. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, repeated low-dose LSD administration was safe in an outpatient setting, but it was not more efficacious than placebo in reducing ADHD symptoms.

This emphasis has largely overlooked its sustained therapeutic effects, which hold significant potential for the development of targeted interventions. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review examines the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of ketamine on PTSD, differentiating between immediate and sustained molecular effects. METHOD: A comprehensive search across databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health, PubMed) and grey literature yielded 317 articles, where 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included preclinical models and clinical trials, through neurotransmitter regulation, gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and neural pathways (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024582874). RESULTS: We found accumulating evidence that the immediate effects of ketamine, which involve changes in GABA, glutamate, and glutamine levels, trigger the re-regulation of BDNF, enhancing synaptic plasticity via pathways such as TrkB and PSD-95. Other molecular influences also include c-Fos, GSK-3, HDAC, HCN1, and the modulation of hormones like CHR and ACTH, alongside immune responses (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α). Sustained effects arise from neurotransmitter remodulations and involve prolonged changes in gene expression. These include mTOR-mediated BDNF expression, alterations in GSK-3β, FkBP5, GFAP, ERK phosphorylation, and epigenetic modifications (DNMT3, MeCP2, H3K27me3, mir-132, mir-206, HDAC). CONCLUSION: These molecular changes promote long-term synaptic stability and re-regulation in key brain regions, contributing to prolonged therapeutic benefits.

Using a crossover design, 34 participants (17 females, 17 males; avg. age 32.2, SD = 8.8) were randomized to 60 min of Floatation-REST or Bed-REST (a control condition on a waterbed). Floatation-REST induced significantly weaker body boundaries, significantly stronger time distortion, and significantly greater relaxation. Post-exposure, participants reported a significantly stronger afterglow, significantly more state mindfulness, and significantly greater interoceptive awareness. Mediation analysis showed relaxation during floating fully explains the afterglow effect. These findings align with psychedelic research, suggesting Floatation-REST elicits similar effects and laying the groundwork for future studies on prolonged afterglow experiences."

This study aimed to determine if: (i) high-dose MDMA drug alerts, and (ii) varied descriptions of dose, effects and actions to reduce harm were associated with intentions to reduce the initial MDMA dose in a hypothetical scenario. METHODS: Australians who used MDMA pills/capsules in the past year completed an online survey.

Psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, is a psychedelic and agonist at the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) that has shown positive therapeutic effects for brain disorders such as depression. To elucidate the brain effects of psilocybin, we directly compared the acute effects of 5-HT2AR agonist (psilocybin) and antagonist (ketanserin) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a single-blind, cross-over study in 28 healthy participants. We evaluated associations between plasma psilocin level (PPL) or subjective drug intensity (SDI) and CBF. We also evaluated drug effects on internal carotid artery (ICA) diameter using time-of-flight MRI angiography. PPL and SDI were significantly negatively associated with regional and global CBF (∼11.6% at peak drug effect, p < 0.0001). CBF did not significantly change following ketanserin (2.3%, p = 0.35). Psilocybin induced a significantly greater decrease in CBF compared to ketanserin in the parietal cortex (pFWER < 0.0001).

METHODS: At baseline, 1 week and 3 months after the psilocybin program participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 (NEO-FFI-3). In addition, after the dosing the Mystical Experiences Questionnaire (MEQ-30), Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI) were administered. Moderation effects were established using linear mixed-model analysis. RESULTS: A single high dose of psilocybin in combination with therapy was found to lower symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD and neuroticism over a period of 3-months. Scores on openness and conscientiousness increased after the treatment only. Participants reported mystical type experiences, emotional breakthrough and personal growth.

INTRODUCTION: There is growing interest in the use of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) for major depressive disorder (MDD), including treatment-resistant depression. We used randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to compare summary estimates of change in depression ratings with PAT versus comparator treatments in MDD. We also compared response and remission rates, and adverse effects. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and SCOPUS from inception till April 2024. Our primary efficacy outcome was 1-week (or nearest) between-group change in depression ratings. Secondary efficacy outcomes were changes in depression ratings at days 2, 14, and 42 (or nearest) and study-defined response and remission rates at week 1 (or nearest). Safety outcomes were reported adverse effects. We pooled outcomes in random-effects meta-analyses using standardized mean difference (SMD; Hedges g) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for categorical outcomes. RESULTS: We found 6 eligible RCTs (pooled N = 427), all on psilocybin.

Depressive symptoms in the perioperative population are associated with a myriad of grave complications, including higher morbidity and mortality. This systematic review aims to determine whether a single dose of intravenous ketamine can be used prophylactically as a routine resilience-enhancing agent in all high-risk adult patients undergoing surgery to mitigate depressive symptoms postoperatively by appraising evidence of existing literature. DESIGN: An evidence-based systematic review. METHODS: The databases PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Search and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used: ""ketamine,"" ""surgical procedures,"" ""surgical,"" ""surgery,"" ""depression,"" and ""depressive disorder."" FINDINGS: In 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), bolus ketamine doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg were administered intraoperatively or in the postanesthesia care unit. The primary outcome was the subjective feelings of depression as evaluated by different validated depression screening tools and seven RCTs observed statistically significant findings between the control and intervention (ketamine) groups with postoperative depression scores. Two RCTs did not find a significant change in depression scores. CONCLUSIONS: Research on the use of prophylactic ketamine as an antidepressant in the perioperative population offers insight into changing routine practices and can shape how mental health is viewed in hospitals. Further research is warranted on the safety profile of ketamine, and risk stratification with careful consideration of baseline depressive symptoms, timing, and its use across a wider variety of surgical subspecialties.","E.

This systematic review aims to determine whether a single dose of intravenous ketamine can be used prophylactically as a routine resilience-enhancing agent in all high-risk adult patients undergoing surgery to mitigate depressive symptoms postoperatively by appraising evidence of existing literature. DESIGN: An evidence-based systematic review. METHODS: The databases PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Search and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used: ""ketamine,"" ""surgical procedures,"" ""surgical,"" ""surgery,"" ""depression,"" and ""depressive disorder."" FINDINGS: In 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), bolus ketamine doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg were administered intraoperatively or in the postanesthesia care unit. The primary outcome was the subjective feelings of depression as evaluated by different validated depression screening tools and seven RCTs observed statistically significant findings between the control and intervention (ketamine) groups with postoperative depression scores. Two RCTs did not find a significant change in depression scores. CONCLUSIONS: Research on the use of prophylactic ketamine as an antidepressant in the perioperative population offers insight into changing routine practices and can shape how mental health is viewed in hospitals. Further research is warranted on the safety profile of ketamine, and risk stratification with careful consideration of baseline depressive symptoms, timing, and its use across a wider variety of surgical subspecialties."

A recent randomized double-blind phase-IIb study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of COMP360, COMPASS Pathways' proprietary synthetic formulation of psilocybin, in participants with treatment-resistant depression. OBJECTIVE: While the phase-IIb results are promising, the treatment works for a portion of the population and early prediction of outcome is a key objective as it would allow early identification of those likely to require alternative treatment. METHODS: Transcripts were made from audio recordings of the psychological support session between participant and therapist 1 day post COMP360 administration. A zero-shot machine learning classifier based on the BART large language model was used to compute two-dimensional sentiment (valence and arousal) for the participant and therapist from the transcript. These scores, combined with the Emotional Breakthrough Index (EBI) and treatment arm were used to predict treatment outcome as measured by MADRS scores.

RESULTS: Two multinomial logistic regression models were fit to predict responder status at week 3 and through week 12. Cross-validation of these models resulted in 85% and 88% accuracy and AUC values of 88% and 85%. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning algorithm using NLP and EBI accurately predicts long-term patient response, allowing rapid prognostication of personalized response to psilocybin treatment and insight into therapeutic model optimization. Further research is required to understand if language data from earlier stages in the therapeutic process hold similar predictive power.","RF. Dougherty, P. Clarke, M. Atli, J. Kuc, D.

RATIONALE: Therapeutic administration of psychedelics has shown significant potential in historical accounts and recent clinical trials in the treatment of depression and other mood disorders. A recent randomized double-blind phase-IIb study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of COMP360, COMPASS Pathways' proprietary synthetic formulation of psilocybin, in participants with treatment-resistant depression. OBJECTIVE: While the phase-IIb results are promising, the treatment works for a portion of the population and early prediction of outcome is a key objective as it would allow early identification of those likely to require alternative treatment. METHODS: Transcripts were made from audio recordings of the psychological support session between participant and therapist 1 day post COMP360 administration. A zero-shot machine learning classifier based on the BART large language model was used to compute two-dimensional sentiment (valence and arousal) for the participant and therapist from the transcript. These scores, combined with the Emotional Breakthrough Index (EBI) and treatment arm were used to predict treatment outcome as measured by MADRS scores. (Code and data are available at https://github.com/compasspathways/Sentiment2D .)
